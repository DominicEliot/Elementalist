card name,question,answer
"Abaddon Succubus","If I target an adjacent enemy already sharing a location with Abaddon Succubus, does it still take 2 damage and heal me 2?","Yes!"
"","If the targeted minion takes less than 2 damage (or no damage at all), do I still heal 2?","Yes!"
"Abundance","Does Abundance apply to my opponent's sites as well?","Yes, they will get the benefit as well, if your Abundance affects their sites!"
"","When do I get this extra mana?","Mana is added to a player's mana pool during their Start Phase, or when a site enters the realm under their control. So, any sites already in play won't get the extra mana until the start of your next turn. But, if you play Abundance and then play a site into Abundance's area of effect, the newly played site will generate extra mana immediately. Also, if you start your turn with a site in Abundance, and then during your Main Phase the site is no longer in Abundance (e.g. Cloud City moving away, Scorched Earth, etc.), you don't lose the mana that you gained during your Start Phase."
"","How much mana is generated by playing an Ordinary Tower (e.g. Lone Tower) into Abundance's effect?","3 mana, because 1 (a site entering the realm under your control) + 1 (Abundance) + 1 (Genesis effect) = 3."
"Abyssal Assault","Can I choose different squares for the damage?","Yes."
"","Is the damage dealt simultaneously?","Yes. For example, if you have a 5 power Monster, it will deal 1+1+1+1+1, all simultaneously. If you try dealing it to a warded unit, the Ward will prevent all of it. If your opponent has Shield Maidens nearby, each damage will be reduced. If you have Panpipes of Pnom, it will be 2+2+2+2+2 damage instead."
"Accusation","What does 'cards or allies' mean?","Cards in their hand, or allies in the realm."
"Adept Illusionist","What does 'shuffle if needed' mean?","If you searched your spellbook, shuffle it. If you end up summoning the extra Illusionist from your hand or cemetery, you may still have searched your spellbook if you wanted."
"Adtonitum","Does this ability work whenever Adtonitum moves, even if it's my opponent's turn?","Yes, this is a triggered ability, which can trigger on your opponent's turn as well, if Adtonitum moves."
"Alabaster Box","Does this need to be carried to have an effect?","Yes, since 'you' or 'your' refers to the controller of the artifact, and carriable artifacts must be carried to be controlled."
"Algor Omphalos","Must spells cast by the Omphalos match its elements?","Yes. Any spell the Omphalos casts much match at least one of its elements."
"Altar of Malachai","Does my avatar still take the damage, but I just don't lose the game?","Correct! Damage is still dealt to your avatar for effects that care about dealing damage. You just don't lose the game as a result!"
"Amethyst Core","When does this artifact provide mana?","When it enters the realm, and at the start of its controller's turn."
"Angel Ascendant","If a warded Angel Ascendant fights another minion, the ward will break when the strike happens. So does Angel Ascendant strike for 2 or 3?","It will strike for 3 (with the +1 power from Ward). If the opposing minion somehow struck first (perhaps via a Lance), then the ward would indeed break first and then the Angel Ascendant would only strike back for 2."
"Animist","If I cast a Magic as a Spirit minion, will Orb of Ba'al Berith copy it?","Good try, but no. You're casting it as a minion, so the game sees it as a Minion spell, not a Magic spell."
"","If I increase or decrease the cost of a magic while I cast it as a Spirit minion, how much power will it have in the realm?","Use the printed cost of the magic as its power, regardless of how much mana you actually spent to cast it. Note that magics with X as their cost work appropriately, based on the unmodified cost of the spell when you cast it."
"","If I cast a magic with X as its cost (e.g. Arcane Barrage) as a Spirit minion, will the minion retain the correct power?","Yes, because of the golden rule. If you pay 7 mana for your Arcane Barrage Spirit minion, it will have 7 power while in the realm."
"","If Selfsame Simulacrum is summoned as a basic copy of an animated magic, what happens?","'Basic copy' refers to the printed characteristics of the card, which means Selfsame will try to become a magic. But magics cannot exist in the realm, so Selfsame Simulacrum would immediately go to the cemetery and there would be no effect of the magic. Sorry!"
"","If I cast a magic as a Spirit minion, do I still get the effect of the magic?","No. Treat the textbox of the magic as entirely blank, though it retains its elements and rarity. For example, if you cast Craterize as Spirit minion, you do not need to discard a site as an additional cost, and it will be summoned as an 8 power, Elite earth minion."
"Apostles of Thamariel","If there are multiple Apostles of Thamariel in play, do I need to track which Apostles go with which Angels?","Yes!"
"Aquamarine Core","When does this artifact provide mana?","When it enters the realm, and at the start of its controller's turn."
"Aramos Mercenaries","Do you still need to meet threshold requirements when using its ability?","Yes, since you're still casting it (and not summoning it directly)."
"Archangel Michael","If Michael cannot take a step, does he still get to strike?","Yes, but you must declare a legal step if you can, using the normal lookahead rules described in 'Range of Motion.'"
"Archimago","When I cast one of the banished spells, is that placed back in the cemetery?","No. There's no way back from being banished, which overrides the part of resolution that would place the card in the cemetery."
"","When I use the Archimago's ability to banish 3 magic spells and cast 1, do I still have to pay mana and meet threshold?","Yes."
"","When using this ability, must the Archimago be the caster?","No, any of your spellcasters can cast the copied spell."
"","What happens if I pay the cost of banishing three spells, but I cannot actually cast any of those three?","If you cannot cast any of those three spells, they remain banished and nothing else happens. You did not cast a spell. (If you can cast one of the three, you must.)"
"","Can I use this ability to cast Valor or Dodge Roll?","No, because the Archimago's ability is an activated ability, which you can only use during your Main Phase when nothing is on the Storyline."
"Army of the Dead","If the Army moves through many locations (e.g. Grapple Shot, Seven-league Boots), does it leave many Skeletons behind?","Yes! Leave a Skeleton behind each time the Army enters a new location (or takes damage)."
"Askelon Phoenix","What is 'fire damage' ?","'Fire damage' is any damage from a fire source, such as a fire minion (including strikes), a fire site, or a fire spell. Morgana le Fay casting Lightning Bolt is not fire damage, since Lightning Bolt is an air spell. Apprentice Wizard casting Firebolts is fire damage because Firebolts is a fire spell (and in fact would be 3 separate instances of fire damage). Anyone casting Grapple Shot that sends a minion into the Phoenix will look at the minion making the strike; if it's a fire minion, it's fire damage. If the Phoenix attacks and there are multiple defenders, each defending fire minion that strikes it counts as a separate source of fire damage."
"Assorted Animals","For purposes of cards that care about the mana cost of spells, what is the mana cost of a spell with X?","If you cast the spell, the mana cost is X. For example, if you cast it for 2 mana, then Immortal Throne would see it as a 2 cost spell. But, if you aren't casting the spell and it's simply in your hand, spellbook, etc., then X is 0 until you actually cast it."
"Atlantean Fate","Can you play Rift Valley into an area affected by Atlantean Fate?","Yes, since Atlantean Fate only affects the site once it's already in play, and Rift Valley modifies how it's played in the first place."
"","If one of the sites it occupies is an Ordinary water site, are minions and artifacts there still submerged?","Yes. It's still affected by the aura, but that effect doesn't do anything to Ordinary sites, other than the Genesis ability."
"Atlas Wanderers","What does 'normal size' mean?","Anything that occupies exactly 1 location."
"","Does this carry along oversized units or auras that occupy more than one square?","No."
"Avatar of Water","What does 'your body of water' mean?","The body of water (if any) that your Avatar currently occupies. If the Avatar isn't in any body of water, the ability won't function. (They're a fish out of water!)"
"","Can you choose an existing water site?","Yes."
"Awakened Mummies","Am I required to summon these units burrowed?","Yes. You can and you must."
"","Do they tap when they unburrow?","No."
"Backstab","Can I target my opponent's minion(s) with Backstab?","Yes (but remember the spellcaster must be in the same region as all the targets)."
"","If a minion has voidwalk and is in the void, could Backstab move it to an adjacent site to strike a tapped minion there?","No. Your spellcaster must target both minions (which are in different regions), but that's impossible since you pick a single location the spellcaster occupies for casting a spell. You can only target minions in the region where the spell is being cast. See '((Casting Spells))' for more details."
"Ball Lightning","Is the damage resolved one at a time, after each hit?","Yes! Resolve the damage (and any deathrites) from the first hit, then bounce for the second hit, resolving that damage, then bounce and resolve the third hit."
"","Can I hit the caster or other allies with this?","At the first location of the projectile's path, it cannot hit allies or the caster, even if it hits an enemy there first. If the Ball Lightning leaves the first location, it could bounce back and hit allies or the caster later in its path."
"","After bouncing off a unit, does the ball hit them again immediately since they are both at the same starting location?","No. But the ball can hit other units at that location after changing direction, bouncing back and forth."
"Balor of the Evil Eye","If I choose to do 2 damage at one location, do I need to do damage at all the locations in that cardinal direction?","Yes. If you choose to resolve this effect, you must deal 2 damage to one unit at each other location in the chosen direction."
"Battlemage","If the Battlemage attacks and kills two enemies in a single fight (if my opponent chose to include multiple defenders), does the Battlemage draw two cards?","Yes."
"","If the Battlemage activates the 'Move and Attack' ability, doesn't actually attack, and then is intercepted, does that count as 'attacking' the intercepting unit?","No. An interception does not cause an 'attack,' and instead is merely a fight between the unit that used 'Move and Attack' and the unit that intercepted."
"","If I declare an attack against one target, but then a different enemy defends, does that satisfy this ability?","Yes. An attack was made, and then a minion was killed. As long as your attacking unit used the Move and Attack ability and then got kill credit, this ability is satisfied."
"","If the Battlemage with a Flaming Sword attacks one enemy, and then another enemy dies as a result of the Flaming Sword, does the Battlemage get to draw a card?","Yes. An attack was made, and then a minion was killed. As long as your attacking unit used the Move and Attack ability and then got kill credit, this ability triggers."
"Beast of Burden","What happens when a minion carries another minion that's carrying a minion?","Only the minions you're directly carrying count against your limit. Have fun at the carnival!"
"Bedrock","If my opponent plays an effect that tries to cancel Bedrock in some way (e.g. Atlantean Fate, Smokestacks of Gnaak, etc.), what happens?","Bedrock wins, and is not modified in any way."
"Begone!","Does this effect target the minion?","No! Therefore, the banished minion can be in a different region and/or have Stealth."
"Bitter Departed","What if there was more than one killer last turn?","Bitter Departed may teleport to any one of the killers to strike it."
"Black Cat","How do I resolve this effect?","The first eight times the cat would die, it doesn't instead. Track it in some reasonable way. If it gains a deathrite, it does not trigger on the first eight lives, since it doesn't actually die. If the cat is moved to an inhospitable location, e.g. underground or underwater, the game will notice and try to kill it along with any other minions who should die. The other minion's deathrite effects will resolve first, and they'll go to the cemetery. Then the game will notice the cat should die, and continue trying to kill it until it's actually dead and goes to the cemetery."
"Black Mass","When I put the cards on the bottom of my spellbook, do the searched cards get shuffled?","Yes."
"Blacksmith Family","Are these family cards of Castle Servants, Common Cottagers, Blacksmith Family, and Fisherman's Family considered Air, Earth, Fire, and Water spells, respectively?","Yes. You can see the spell's colored frame matches those elements, so Castle Servants is an Air spell, Common Cottagers is an Earth spell, Blacksmith Family is a Fire spell, and Fisherman's Family is a Water Spell."
"Bladedancer","How do I resolve this ability?","Fully complete the first attack, including deathrites. Then, Bladedancer must take a step to a different location to be able to attack a new unit (or the same unit if it's oversized and occupies multiple locations). The step cannot be intercepted, but the attack is an actual second attack, following the normal attack sequence."
"Blasphemy","How do I resolve this effect?","Each minion simultaneously deals 1 damage to its site. Then, starting with the active player and then the non-active player, each minion chooses an artifact at it's location to destroy; you must choose an artifact that hasn't been chosen if possible. Then, all the artifacts are simultaneously destroyed. Finally, all minions tap (and won't untap the next time they normally would)."
"Blasted Oak","How can I tell if a spell or non-basic ability targets something?","It will use the word 'target.'"
"","Are random events affected?","No. Something like Lightning Bolt ('Deal 3 damage to a random unit at target location') must target Blasted Oak's location, but then the random result is still determined randomly"
"","What happens if you have Kythera Mechanism?","When you target, you must follow Blasted Oak's restrictions, but you can still choose random outcomes of your choice if you have Kythera Mechanism."
"","Does summoning a minion target the location where it's summoned?","No, and therefore Blasted Oak doesn't influence where minions may be summoned."
"","How does this interact with Chain Lightning?","You must target all the units you can that share Blasted Oak's site, spending as much mana as needed to do so. Once you've targeted all those units, you could additionally target other units, if you had sufficient mana. For reference, Chain Lightning reads: Deal 2 damage to target unit nearby. Any number of times, you may spend 2 mana to additionally target a new unit nearby the previous one."
"Blaze","What is the proper timing of resolution for this effect?","If the Blazing unit moves and attacks, the proper sequence is to resolve the move, then deal 2 damage at each departed location simultaneously, then resolve the attack."
"","If the Blazing unit moves over the same location multiple times without stopping, how much damage does Blaze do?","Blaze will still only do 2 damage, since a unit is either along the trail, or not. Each time the Blazing unit stops, it creates a separate trail of fire."
"","If the Blazing unit dies, does it deal damage where it died?","No. Though it clearly departed its location, it never 'stops,' which is what causes the flame to cause damage. To 'stop,' a unit needs to move first. (Note that if the Blazing unit somehow died while moving, then Blaze would in fact deal damage when the unit died.)"
"","Is this magic damage?","Yes. The source of the damage is the Blaze spell, not the unit."
"","If a Blazing Megamoeba moves, does Blaze do damage?","No, since the Megamoeba still occupies the sites and thus never departed."
"Bleeding Skull","Does this need to be carried to have an effect?","Yes, since 'you' or 'your' refers to the controller of the artifact, and carriable artifacts must be carried to be controlled."
"Blink","Can a disabled unit Blink?","Yes, this is forced movement, not taking a step themselves."
"","The beta foil version of Blink and Blizzard have their the title, mana cost, and typeline swapped. Is that a misprint?","Yes, this is a misprint. These are not legal for tournament play."
"Blizzard","The beta foil version of Blink and Blizzard have their the title, mana cost, and typeline swapped. Is that a misprint?","Yes, this is a misprint. These are not legal for tournament play."
"Blood Mana","Do I still need to meet threshold requirements and pay additional costs, e.g. discarding a site for Craterize?","Yes!"
"","How does Blood Mana interact with reduced costs?","The same cost you would pay with mana is paid by your life instead."
"","Can I pay more life than I have? What if I'm on death's door?","You cannot pay more life than you have. If you're on death's door, you won't be able to pay any life and Blood Mana won't help you."
"","What happens if the next spell I cast is Twist of Fate?","Let's say your life is 16 and my life is 20. Therefore, you cast Twist of Fate for 4 mana, but instead of mana, you pay 4 life. Your life is now 12 and the magic goes onto the Storyline. The magic resolves, swapping our life totals. My life is now 12 and your life is 20. Tricky!"
"Bodach Bogeyman","How do I resolve this effect?","You may simultaneously pick up from all adjacent locations. Anything picked up is forcefully moved to the Bogeyman's location. Once it arrives, it is disabled."
"Boneyard","What is the proper timing of resolution for this effect?","Non-active player chooses a minion. Active player chooses a minion. Both minions enter the realm simultaneously. Then, the non-active player resolves any triggered abilities (like genesis), and finally the active player resolves their triggered abilities."
"Book of Blessings","If my magic targets my allied minion, does that qualify as 'chooses' for the Book of Blessing?","Yes!"
"Brobdingnag Bullfrog","Does the swallowed minion untap? Is it still in the realm? Can it be attacked?","Yes."
"","If the swallowed minion is moved away somehow, does it lose Disabled?","Yes."
"Bureau of Occult Control","How does this effect resolve?","'Access' occurs if a card would leave the collection or cemetery zone. You may still freely look at your collection and cemetery, and add cards to them. For example, Archimago must pay (2) to use his ability. Similarly, Deathspeaker must pay (2) to use his ability. If an effect is resolving (and not paying a cost like Archimago or Deathspeaker), you may choose not to pay the (2) and have that part of the effect fail. For example, Feast for Crows may search the other zones and simply not remove any spells from cemetery."
"Buried Treasure","Do I get the cards immediately when my minion carrying the treasure moves to the surface, even in the middle of something else (like defending or attacking) ?","Yes! As soon as your unit is on the surface, you resolve the treasure effect."
"Caelestis","Do I still need to meet threshold and summoning requirements when I cast the spell?","Yes. E.g. It must still be cast to your own site."
"Cage of Sidrak","What does it mean to 'lock' a minion here, and how does the Cage work?","All minions with 2 or less power are teleported to the Cage and are carried by it. If the Cage moves, the carried minions move with it. While locked in the cage, the minions remain tapped and disabled. If a minion is somehow no longer carried by the Cage, it is free and no longer disabled. If a minion somehow becomes carried by the Cage (e.g. Swap), it is tapped and disabled."
"Captain Baldassare","If Captain Baldassare attacks a 3 power minion, killing it but also dying in the process, does the Captain have time to use their ability before they die?","Yes, by a long shot! In fact, Captain Baldassare's trigger happens as soon as the attack is resolving, even before strikes are made. The trigger for Captain's ability and the Captain dying aren't in the same window of time. The ability triggers first."
"Castle Haunt","If Castle Haunt is summoned to a void, e.g. Lucid Dreamers, how does its ability apply?","It was never summoned to a site, so it's free to roam around the realm! (Unless it was summoned to The Void site, in which case its restriction applies normally!)"
"","If Castle Haunt leaves its summoning site and doesn't immediately die, what happens?","It's free to roam around the realm! This could happen because the Castle Haunt is silenced or disabled as soon as it leaves its summoning site, or because it survives via a Ward upon leaving. If it ever returns to its summoning site, its ability will apply again if it tries to leave again."
"Castle Servants","Are these family cards of Castle Servants, Common Cottagers, Blacksmith Family, and Fisherman's Family considered Air, Earth, Fire, and Water spells, respectively?","Yes. You can see the spell's colored frame matches those elements, so Castle Servants is an Air spell, Common Cottagers is an Earth spell, Blacksmith Family is a Fire spell, and Fisherman's Family is a Water Spell."
"Cerberus in Chains","What does 'your location' mean?","In this case, 'your location' means 'a location that your avatar occupies.'"
"","What does 'can't move itself away' mean?","Cerberus can't choose to move to a location that is farther from your avatar than its current location. (Count distance using steps that Cerberus would take using its own modes of movement, e.g. Airborne if it gained it somehow.)"
"","If your avatar occupies a site you don't control, can you summon Cerberus there?","No. The first sentence is an additional restriction on summoning."
"","How does Cerberus in Chains automatically follow you?","Whenever your avatar enters a new location, Cerberus in Chains teleports to that location."
"Chain Lightning","Do I pay all the costs and choose all the targets when the spell is cast?","Yes."
"","Does the damage resolve sequentially or simultaneously?","All targets take the damage simultaneously."
"","Can I chain the lightning from target A to target B back to target A?","No, that's not what 'new' means. You can only choose new targets that haven't already been targeted by the spell."
"","Can additional targets be in different regions (as long as they're nearby the previous target)?","No. Being nearby the previous target is an additional targeting restriction, not a loosening of the targeting rules, so all targets must be in the same region as the caster."
"Chaos Twister","Does the minion teleport to the location where it lands?","Yes. It teleports to the surface of the site (or void) where it lands."
"","What if the minion lands in the void?","It deals no damage (even to itself). Since it's now in the void, it is banished (unless it has Voidwalk)."
"","What if the minion lands atop two or more sites?","It lands on only a single site, which is the one that it most fully overlaps."
"","What if I'm using Chaos Twister on a token? Or a really expensive card with triple sleeves?","Feel free to use a stand-in."
"","Does the minion continue to carry whatever it was carrying?","Yes."
"","How should I resolve this card in a tournament setting?","This card as-written represents part of our design philosophy for Sorcery. Apply the birthday candle rule, which is that you must blow the card off your hand in a single breath; if you do not, then the effect fails. If the card falls prior to starting to blow, replace it on your hand. Once you start blowing, if the card falls due to anything other than blowing (e.g. hand movement), the effect fails. Call a judge before resolving this card if you're worried, but please be cool and apply the golden rule!"
"","What if the minion doesn't land in the grid at all?","The teleportation effect doesn't happen and it deals no damage."
"Chaoswish","Where does the copied spell come from?","It's a copy, which is a token, so you have unlimited copies, as needed. It doesn't come from your hand or your deck or anywhere else. It's a token!"
"","If I have Kythera Mechanism and keep 'randomly' choosing Chaoswish, can I cast infinite spells?","Specify the number of times you cast Chaoswish, and then proceed with the game. Your opponent will have the chance to copy Chaoswish that number of times!"
"","How do I generate a random spell?","Click the button on this page!"
"","Once I cast a random spell, how do I track it during the game?","Be prepared with index cards + pencil, or some other way to track what gets copied! Note that a copy is a token, so once it leaves the realm, it's banished per normal token rules. Magics (and any other copy) won't end up in the cemetery."
"","What happens if the random spell cannot be cast, e.g. no valid target?","The spell is not cast, and the next player may copy Chaoswish."
"","What if the random spell has additional costs, e.g. Craterize?","When you cast '((for free)),' you don't pay any additional costs. Have fun!"
"","Must I choose which of my spellcasters is casting the spell before I know what it is?","Yes."
"","What happens if I play Courtesan Thaïs and then immediately play Chaoswish on the same turn?","It's still your turn, so your opponent still controls their own choices. They can freely choose to copy Chaoswish or not. On the other hand, if you cast Courtesan Thaïs first, then on your opponent's turn (which you're controlling) you see that they have Chaoswish in hand and you cast it for them, you can keep copying Chaoswish as long as you want; you will decide for yourself and you will decide for them (since you're controlling their turn)."
"","If my opponent and I keep deciding to copy Chaoswish, what happens?","You have a lot of fun? In a tournament setting, you'll probably hit the round time limit eventually."
"Char Omphalos","Must spells cast by the Omphalos match its elements?","Yes. Any spell the Omphalos casts much match at least one of its elements."
"Clay Golem","Is the site played adjacent to the Clay Golem, superseding normal site placement rules?","Yes!"
"Cloud City","Does this carry along oversized minions or auras that occupy more than one square?","No. If an oversized minion is now occupying the void, it will be banished. (Megamoeba will still move with Cloud City.)"
"","Does this carry along oversized units or auras that occupy more than one square?","No."
"Common Cottagers","Are these family cards of Castle Servants, Common Cottagers, Blacksmith Family, and Fisherman's Family considered Air, Earth, Fire, and Water spells, respectively?","Yes. You can see the spell's colored frame matches those elements, so Castle Servants is an Air spell, Common Cottagers is an Earth spell, Blacksmith Family is a Fire spell, and Fisherman's Family is a Water Spell."
"Cone of Flame","Does Cone of Flame extend across multiple regions?","No, all affected locations must be in the same region as the caster. By default, the damage grid is restricted to the caster's region. If the caster occupies multiple regions (e.g. a oversized unit), pick a single region where you're casting the spell."
"","All the empty boxes are void and the letters are sites. If the spell is cast from the surface of X, is Z affected?","Yes, because it's the same region as the spell effect, even though it's separated by void."
"Conqueror Worm","If I control Rubble, can my opponent still play a site there?","Yes, but it might only feed the worm."
"Consecrated Ground","Does 'has no power here' mean Evil units here have zero power?","Yes. Note that when you strike, you determine your power first, then you determine how much damage you deal. So an Evil minion with a Lance would still strike a unit for 1 damage, because it has 0 power and then gets +1 damage from the Lance. See '((Damage))' for more details."
"Corpse Explosion","How do I resolve this effect?","Deal face up, one at a time, taking minions from any cemetery. You choose which minions you deal to each site. The dead minions do not actually 'enter' the realm with this effect. Then, damage is dealt simultaneously."
"Corruptor","Does the type of my minions change everywhere, or just in the realm?","Everywhere!"
"","Does this ability completely replace their normal type, or simply add a new type?","It adds an additional type. For example, your Mortals are Undead and Mortals and would still be silenced by Bower of Bliss. As another example, your Beasts are Monsters and Beasts, so you would still get the discount from a Pond."
"Courtesan Thaïs","What does it mean for one player to be controlled by another player?","If you control a player, you see all their cards and make all decisions for them. You still must make legal choices for them. For example, you still cannot force their minion to move into the void (without Voidwalk) or attack themselves."
"","What happens if there are multiple copies of Courtesan Thaïs played, overlapping each other?","The effects can overlap. They do not add additional turns of control beyond what's specified by card text. For example, Turn 1: Player A plays Courtesan 1. Turn 2: Player B is controlled by Player A due to Courtesan 1's effect, and plays Courtesan 2. Turn 3: Player A is controlled by Player B due to Courtesan 1's effect and Courtesan 2's effect. Turn 4: Player B is controlled by Player A due to Courtesan 2's effect."
"","The beta foil version has 1 fire threshold and the normal version has 2 fire threshold. Which is correct?","The normal version is correct. You still need 2 fire affinity to cast this minion."
"","What happens if my turn is skipped via Vaults of Zul and Courtesan Thaïs is affecting me?","If a turn is skipped then there's no actual turn, which means that part of Courtesan Thaïs's effect would wait for that player's next actual turn."
"","When I control my opponent's turn, can I force them to concede?","No. Stop it."
"Cradle of Etherrum","Do I still need to meet threshold and summoning requirements when I cast the spell?","Yes. It must be cast during your main phase, to your own site, etc. It's an otherwise normal minion spell being cast, except that it's coming from the top of your library instead of your hand, and costs (1) less."
"","Is the ability to look at my top spell a passive abililty?","Yes. You may look any time on your turn, including during your Start Phase and End Phase."
"Craterize","Do I have to choose 'above' or 'below,' or does it damage both automatically?","There is a giant meteor landing in the realm! It damages both above and ((below)) - surface, underwater, and underground!"
"","All the empty boxes are void and the letters are sites. If the spell is cast from the surface of X, is Z affected?","Yes, because it's the same region as the spell effect, even though it's separated by void."
"Crave Golem","Can Crave Golem attack itself?","No, per normal attack restrictions (which the Crave Golem respects)."
"","Does it use normal targeting rules when attacking?","Yes, except that it may attack other allied minions if they happen to be the chosen target. It still cannot attack Airborne or Stealth units unless it gains a special ability that allows it to do so."
"","How do I properly resolve this ability?","First, identify all the minions that Crave Golem ))can attack(( within its range of motion. If there are one or more such minions: Randomly pick one, then move (if needed), and attack it. This counts as a normal attack and may be defended. For example, if there's one adjacent minion with Airborne and another without Airborne, it will attack the non-Airborne minion 100% of the time (unless Crave Golem somehow gained Airborne). If there are no such minions: Imagine the Crave Golem had unlimited movement. Are there any minions it could attack now? If not, it doesn't move and the ability is over. If so, take one step toward the minion that requires the fewest Crave Golem steps to reach. (Crave Golem's controller's choice if tied.) This movement cannot be intercepted."
"","Does it tap to take a step or attack?","No."
"","When it attacks, does the targeted unit strike back?","Yes."
"","When it attacks, do normal combat rules apply with defending?","Yes."
"Critical Strike","If I double twice, is it multiplied by 4?","Yes."
"Crown Prince","If I sacrifice Crown Prince (e.g. Moon Clan Werewolf, Cauldron Crones, etc.), does its deathrite still trigger?","Yes! When you sacrifice something, it dies, and thus triggers deathrite."
"Crusade","The term 'summon' means 'enter the realm.' So, does that mean I can play minions here for free?","No. This effect simply provides additional locations where you may summon your earth minions."
"Dank Omphalos","Must spells cast by the Omphalos match its elements?","Yes. Any spell the Omphalos casts much match at least one of its elements."
"Darkest Dungeon","What path can I choose when resolving this ability?","See ((Moving to a Specific Location Via a Special Ability or Magic)) in the Codex."
"Day of Judgment","Can I rotate the cross?","Yes."
"","Must the cross be entirely within the realm?","Yes. Evil can cower safely in the corners!"
"","Does this affect multiple regions, such as the void and subsurface as well?","Yes! The card text uses 'affected squares,' which include surface, subsurface, and void."
"","How do I properly resolve the banish and damage effects?","Banish Evil minions first, resolving effects (if any) as a result of their banishment. Then, damage all units occupying those five squares."
"De Vermis Mysteriis","Can I modify the cost of (5)?","Yes! If you have Philosopher's Stone and you're playing as Harbinger, you could perhaps cast minions for a mere (3)!"
"Death Dealer","Does it kill minions everywhere in the realm, even in the void or underground or underwater?","Yes."
"Deathspeaker","At Death's Door, does the Deathspeaker need to meet the threshold requirements?","Yes. Only the casting cost is reduced to (0)."
"","Can any of my spellcasters cast a spell and still benefit from my avatar's ability?","Yes! As long as you control the spellcaster, the game sees it as a spell '((you))' cast, meaning the player."
"","When using the Deathspeaker's ability, do I trigger Deathrite effects (perhaps because the minion is on The Geistwood)?","Normally no, because Deathrite only triggers when the minion dies, and the Deathspeaker's ability banishes the minion. But, if you somehow kill the minion at the same time it enters the realm (e.g. Bottomless Pit), then Deathrite would trigger. The token dies because of Bottomless Pit (interrupting the Deathspeaker's ability), Deathrite resolves, then the token copy is banished like all tokens when it dies."
"","How does this ability resolve, in detail?","You cast the minion spell. Pay mana, meet threshold, banish it from the cemetery, identify where it will be summoned. The minion enters the the realm. (It is a copy of the banished minion.) 'Enter the ))realm((' effects trigger and resolve. These include: Genesis abilities. Effects like Wayfaring Pilgrim, Giant Shark, Mariner's Curse, Bottomless Pit, etc. See '((Simultaneous Triggers))' in the Codex for more details. The minion is banished. The intent is that the Deathspeaker can speak to the dead, invoke their abilities, and then release them into the afterlife (whatever that may be). See also '((Splitting Events on the Storyline))' and the example with Tawny plus a site's genesis. The Deathspeaker's ability is analogous, since the minion will enter, splitting the Deathspeaker's ability on the Storyline, the genesis ability will resolve (along with any other triggered abilities based on a minion entering the ))realm((), then it will get banished."
"","When using the Deathspeaker's ability, do Genesis abilities trigger before the banishing effect?","Yes, because events on the storyline are split up when a card enters the realm. See the '((Splitting Events on the Storyline))' codex entry for more details."
"","Can I cast minions from my opponent's cemetery?","Yes. You control it when it enters the realm, and then it gets banished."
"Deathwish","What if my current life is higher than my maximum life after this effect resolves?","Your current life is immediately reduced to your maximum life."
"","If an avatar has an odd maximum life, do they round down after halving it?","Yes."
"Demonic Contract","What is all of the small text on this card?!","Don't tell me you entered into a contract with a Demon without reading the fine print! The smaller text is all of the rules and stipulations for the casting of this spell!"
"","What is 'lower' rarity?","The order of rarities (from highest to lowest) is: Unique, Elite, Exceptional, and Ordinary. For example, if you control an Exceptional Demon, you could search for an Exceptional or Ordinary spell."
"Divine Intervention","Does this count as healing?","No, this removes Death's Door and then sets your life to 1."
"","What if I cast this while my life is higher than 1?","You set your life to 1."
"Divine Lance","If I break two allied Wards to increase the damage, will it be three instances of 1 damage each, or 3 damage once?","Three damage once."
"Dodge Roll","If Dodge Roll's mana cost is increased (e.g. Maddening Bells), can you cast it on your opponent's turn?","No, because you don't have any mana available on your opponent's turn."
"Dome of Osiros","If a minion here is attacked what happens?","It's not possible to declare an attack against a minion here. If you attack an avatar here and a minion defends, the minion becomes a legal target, per the Defend rules."
"","Does this site protect minions from cards with the word 'attack' in their name, like Leap Attack or Spin Attack?","No. Dome of Osiros only prevents 'attacks' from the Move and Attack basic ability, or other card text that uses the word 'attack' (e.g. Crave Golem)."
"Dormant Monstrosity","When counting 'each unit,' do I include all adjacent squares?","Yes! Count any unit in any square adjacent to the summoning square (including the summoning square itself). Each unit counts once, regardless of how many adjacent squares it occupies."
"Dragonlord","When do I choose my set aside Dragon? Can it change during a tournament?","You must select your set aside Dragon 'before setup,' which means during deckbuilding. You cannot change it during a tournament. The Dragonlord is loyal to his champion and would not be so fickle!"
"","Can my spellbook include a copy of my set aside Unique Dragon?","Yes! The set aside Dragon is intended as a rules reference for both players. You may use a suitable substitute for the set aside Dragon, if needed."
"","When the Dragonlord gains the abilities of the set aside Dragon, does the Dragonlord gain its power as well?","No, power is a characteristic, not an ability. The Dragonlord will only gain the abilities printed in the text box."
"","Can the Dragonlord gain Stealth?","No. Avatars cannot gain Stealth."
"","If the Dragonlord gains Voidwalk, Burrowing, or Submerge, may it enter other regions?","No. Avatars cannot enter any region other than the surface."
"","If the Dragonlord gains Ignis Rex's ability, is that considered fire damage? Same question for Adtonitum and air damage?","Yes! If the Dragonlord gains Ignis Rex's ability and then discards a fire card, the Dragonlord will deal fire damage. Same answer for Adtonitum and air damage."
"Dread Thicket","What does 'attack out of this site' mean?","Take exactly one step away from the site, then attack. It doesn't matter if the unit took steps before entering the Dread Thicket, merely that they take exactly one step away from the Thicket and then attack."
"Dream-Quest","Can I cast this on my Avatar, since they are a spellcaster?","Your avatar can't be disabled per their characteristics. Thus, they won't be able to go to sleep, and therefore won't be able to wake up. If you cast this on your Avatar, it will have no effect."
"Drought","Can Floodplain still flood a site affected by Drought?","Yes. See '((Example - Flood vs. Drought))' in the codex."
"","How do Drought and Flood interact?","See '((Example - Flood vs. Drought))' in the codex."
"Druid","Does the Druid's flip side ability work with Poisonous Dagger?","No. The site itself gains the ability and is doing the damage."
"","Can the Druid's flip side ability give the Druid kill credit?","No. Only units can get kill credit, and the site is source of the damage. The triggered ability is the site's ability, not the Druid's. See the '((kill credit))' codex entry for more details."
"","If a site loses its abilities, does the Druid's flip side ability still apply? Can this affect Bedrock?","No. The Druid grants an ability to the site. If the site is silenced (or can't be modified in the case of Bedrock), then it loses the ability and will not deal damage."
"Duplicator","How does this ability impact my collection?","You may include any cards you wish in your collection, following normal deckbuilding rules. If you have 0 copies of a unique card in your deck, you may include 1 ))copy(( in your collection. If you have 2 copies of a unique card in your deck, you cannot include any copies in your collection."
"Dwarven Digging Team","If I have Dwarven Digging Team in play, can I choose to summon minions underground without a printed Burrowing ability?","No. The units don't gain Burrowing until they're at nearby sites, and you must choose the summoning location when you cast the spell. When you cast the minion spell, it doesn't have burrowing yet, and thus you cannot pick an underground location."
"Earthquake","What does 'normal size' mean?","Anything that occupies exactly 1 location."
"","Does this carry along oversized units or auras that occupy more than one square?","No."
"","If the 2x2 area includes some sites and some void, can you rearrange the sites into the void squares?","No. You can rearrange sites with other sites as you wish, but the void squares must remain the same."
"East-West Dragon","Does diagonal movement include 'sideways' movement?","No."
"Edge of the World","What happens if Edge of the World's ability is lost (e.g. Smokestacks of Gnaak), then Edge of the World gets surrounded by sites, then its ability is regained (e.g. Smokestacks of Gnaak moves away)?","In this rare case, Edge of the World would destroy itself."
"","What happens if an effect causes edge of the world to not be adjacent to the void?","The effect does not resolve. Examples:
If you try to move Cloud City to the only void square adjacent to Edge of the World, Cloud City won't move.
If you try to play a site from your hand, it won't work and your site will remain in your hand.
If you use Earthquake to rearrange sites in a way that Edge of the World isn't adjacent to void, the entire rearrangement fails (and then you still try to burrow.)
If you have two Magellan Globes in play at the same location and they're the only thing keeping Edge of the World adjacent to void and they are Dispelled, one is destroyed and other isn't."
"Enchantress","Turning auras into minions!? Is this real?","Yes, indeed. Enchantress is a very versatile Avatar, and one that twists the rules to create very interesting games. Be sure to check these FAQs as well as the auras you're looking to animate. Since many auras occupy a 2x2 area in the realm, you may want to learn about oversized units as well."
"","What is the proper timing of resolution for this effect?","Whenever you cast a spell, before that spell resolves, but after targets are specified. See the 'storyline' entry for more details."
"","Can you animate your opponent's auras?","Yes, as long as you can target them (i.e. they are in the same region as the Enchantress). Your opponent still controls the aura minion."
"","Can any of my spellcasters cast a spell and still benefit from my avatar's ability?","Yes! As long as you control the spellcaster, the game sees it as a spell '((you))' cast, meaning the player."
"","Do animated aura change size?","No."
"","If Magellan Globe is in play and an Oversized unit on the top row moves 'up' one row to wrap around to the bottom, what happens?","Since Magellan Globe is an ongoing effect that connects the top and bottom edges, the oversized unit can occupy 2 locations on the top row and 2 locations on the bottom row. Ensure that game state is clear, using notes as needed."
"","If Polar Explorers or Ruler of Thul are in play and an oversized unit on the top row moves 'up' one row to wrap around to the bottom, what happens?","This ability only allows movement across the borders, not ongoing occupation. Units cannot balance on the edge of the realm and an oversized unit that finds its way there falls to one side or the other. Its controller places it in the closest legal position, controller's choice if tied."
"","If Magellan Globe leaves play when a card is spanning the edge of the realm, what happens?","Units cannot balance on the edge of the realm and an oversized unit that finds its way there falls to one side or the other. Its controller places it in the closest legal position, controller's choice if tied."
"Entangle Terrain","Does this affect subsurface units, as well as surface?","Yes, since it doesn't say 'atop.' Note that it doesn't affect minions in the void, since the void isn't a site."
"Erik's Curiosa","Do I really have to rip it to pieces?","Please see the golden rule! The point is to actually, literally rip the card up, so it will never be playable again. It is banished after you rip it."
"","How does this work in a tournament, especially in best of 1 games, when I rip this?","See the rules for that specific tournament, but by default the card is playable. Tournament organizers have latitude to set rules for their events, but one reasonable approach is that you use a deck missing one card for the rest of the tournament (and it's legal to do so)."
"","If my opponent gains control of my Erik's Curiosa and then they rip it, who gets to pick the card?","They get a card of the controller's choice from the controller's collection (so they get to pick). Hopefully you can still be friends! (They must give you a moment to concede before they rip it.)"
"","Does this effect let me break the normal restrictions on deck legality? e.g. duplicate Unique card, or duplicate any site for Pathfinder?","The card limits exist only when the game starts; once the game begins, various effects can change your deck composition. So, yes, you are free to get an extra copy of a Unique card via Erik's Curiosa, as long as the card is actually in your collection."
"Ersatz Platz","How do I resolve this effect?","When you would use your avatar's ability (or another ability to play sites without restriction), you may choose to play that site from your collection and banish Ersatz Platz."
"Evil Presence","The term 'summon' means 'enter the realm.' So, does that mean I can play minions here for free?","No. This effect simply provides additional locations where you may summon your minions."
"Faith Incarnate","Does this effect count all wards in the realm, or only ones I control?","It counts all wards in the realm, on any unit or site!"
"Falling Star","If my summoned minion has a genesis effect, does the genesis resolve before the strike?","Yes, resolve the genesis first, including any deathrites. Then, the 'strike each other unit' effect resolves."
"","Are the strikes against other units all simultaneous?","Yes."
"","How does this resolve if I summon an oversized minion?","At least one of the summoning sites must include an affected site. The 'strike each other unit where it lands' effect occurs on one affected site of your choice (that the summoned minion occupies)."
"Far East Assassin","When you use the ability, what happens to the 'thrown' artifact?","It is no longer carried by the Assassin, and is uncontrolled in the target's location. Any unit may pick it up normally (including the Assassin, if it happens to be in that location)."
"","Does the Assassin lose Stealth if it uses its ability?","Yes. It's an activated special ability, so Stealth is lost per the normal Stealth rules."
"Fey Changeling","Can this be summoned to an inhospitable location (e.g. underground) and die, but still have a chance to use its genesis ability first?","No. You cannot choose to summon a minion underground, underwater, or in the void unless it has the appropriate ability."
"","The term 'summon' means 'enter the realm.' So, does that mean I can play this minion for free?","No. This effect simply provides additional locations where you may summon this minion."
"Fire Harpoons!","Does the 'adjacent Water site' need to be in the same region as the caster?","No. Because the Water site is not targeted, and because the card text uses 'site' instead of 'location,' the site does not need to be in the same region as the caster."
"","Can I cast this spell without a target just to draw a card?","No. To cast a spell, you must specify all targets."
"","Does the target need to be in the same region as the caster?","No. Normally the answer is yes, but the card text 'above or ((below))' means that normal targeting restrictions are ignored, and the caster can be in any region (surface, underground, underwater, or in the void). As long as there is an adjacent Water site to the caster and a minion occupying that water site, it will get pulled to the caster's location."
"Firebolts","What does 'one at a time' mean?","Resolve the first bolt (including any deathrite or other 'kills' abilities), then resolve the next one, then resolve the 3rd one. Each bolt must go in the same direction."
"Fisherman's Family","Are these family cards of Castle Servants, Common Cottagers, Blacksmith Family, and Fisherman's Family considered Air, Earth, Fire, and Water spells, respectively?","Yes. You can see the spell's colored frame matches those elements, so Castle Servants is an Air spell, Common Cottagers is an Earth spell, Blacksmith Family is a Fire spell, and Fisherman's Family is a Water Spell."
"Flagellant","If damage is prevented, do I still heal?","No. Flagellant must actually take 1 or more damage for you to heal."
"","If Flagellant takes 5 damage, do I heal more than 1?","No, just 1. But if Flagellant took 1 damage separately five times, e.g. Abyssal Assault or Arcane Barrage, you would heal 5."
"Flame Wave","Can the grid pattern be flipped horizontally?","Yes. You pick the leftmost or rightmost column, and that is where the Flame Wave starts."
"","Can the grid pattern be rotated 90 degrees?","No."
"Flamecaller","Is the projectile considered fire damage?","Yes."
"Flaming Sword","If the attack damage was increased or decreased, does the splash damage include the change?","Yes. For example, Critical Strike will splash double damage."
"","If a unit has two Flaming Swords, do they each splash damage?","Yes. Have fun dual wielding!"
"","Is the splash damage a strike?","No. It's damage done by the sword artifact."
"","Does the splash damage occur whenever the unit strikes?","Yes. For example, that includes Grapple Shot or other strikes, not just attacks from the Move and Attack basic ability."
"","If the struck unit isn't an enemy, is any damage splashed?","No. If there's no 'struck unit,' then it has no location. Also, there are no 'other enemies' when there's no enemy initially. See '((enemy))' in the codex."
"","If the Battlemage with a Flaming Sword attacks one enemy, and then another enemy dies as a result of the Flaming Sword, does the Battlemage get to draw a card?","Yes. An attack was made, and then a minion was killed. As long as your attacking unit used the Move and Attack ability and then got kill credit, this ability triggers."
"Flanking Maneuver","Do the locations need to be in the same region?","No. The squares merely need to be a Knight's move apart. Teleportation ignores normal movement restrictions."
"Flood","How do Drought and Flood interact?","See '((Example - Flood vs. Drought))' in the codex."
"Floodplain","Can Floodplain still flood a site affected by Drought?","Yes. See '((Example - Flood vs. Drought))' in the codex."
"","Can I use Floodplain before Maelström triggers?","No. Floodplain is an activated ability, which can only be activated during your Main Phase."
"Free City","Can my Free City be struck by opposing units, and if so, will it take damage?","Yes, it can be struck, and any strike damage to your Free City will cause your avatar to ))lose(( the same amount of life."
"","How do the strikes work?","Normally, only units can strike, but card text allows the Free City site to strike as if it were a unit with 3 power."
"","Can Free City die?","It's striking as if it were a unit, but it's still a site. Therefore, it won't die due to damage. It can still be destroyed by a specific destruction effect (e.g. Sinkhole), but it won't die due to taking damage."
"","When can it attack?","Free City's ability is a passive ability that gives it the option to attack and defend 'normally' once per turn, as if it were a 3 power unit (while actually remaining a site). Therefore, it can only attack on your turn, and defend (presumably on your opponent's turn) when a unit or Free City itself is attacked by an enemy unit occupying Free City. If Free City would somehow have the chance to both attack AND defend on your turn, it can only do one."
"","What can it attack?","The key word is 'here.' Clearly burrowed units are 'here.' Airborne and Stealthed units are also 'here.' But, to attack Airborne or Stealth, a unit needs some special ability (e.g. Airborne, Ranged, etc.) Since Free City doesn't have those abilities, it can't actually target Airborne or Stealthed units with an attack."
"","How does the attack work?","Since the ability to attack is granted by a card effect and not a basic ability, no tapping is needed, but it's still an attack. Therefore, players may declare defenders for the attack normally."
"","Can Free City attack the turn it enters play?","Yes, because only minions are subject to summoning sickness."
"","If an oversized unit occupies Free City while it attacks a different site, can Free City defend against that attack?","No, since the attack is not happening on Free City."
"Frontier Settlers","Can Frontier Settlers play a site that isn't adjacent to your other sites?","Yes."
"Geomancer","When I play an Earth site using the second ability, do I also place a rubble in an adjacent void?","No. You only place a rubble if you play an Earth site using the first ability."
"","When I play an Earth site using the first ability, where does the rubble appear?","The rubble must be placed adjacent to your Geomancer. If there's no void adjacent to your Geomancer, then no rubble is placed."
"","Does Mirror Realm (copying an earth site) or Valley of Delight (choosing earth) count for Geomancer's first ability?","Yes. Mirror ))Realm(( works because it applies as it enters the realm. Valley of Delight works because the Genesis effect of the site interrupts the resolution of the Geomancer's ability; when the second part of Geomancer's ability actually resolves and looks at the site, the site is indeed an earth (E) site. See '((Splitting Events on the Storyline))' for more details on Valley of Delight interaction, analogous to the Tawny example and splitting the Druid's ability."
"Ghost Ship","If I teleport my Ghost Ship from the void to a site, does its ability trigger?","Yes."
"","If I summon a Spirit from my opponent's cemetery, do I control it?","Yes. (And as usual for an explicit summon effect, you don't need threshold and you don't pay mana.)"
"Giant Shark","Will it fight units that are Airborne or Stealthed?","Yes. This isn't an attack (which has targeting restrictions), but actually a fight (which simply specifies who fights based on card text)."
"","What path can I choose when resolving this ability?","See ((Moving to a Specific Location Via a Special Ability or Magic)) in the Codex."
"","Will it fight your own units?","Yes."
"","Does 'enters' include minions that are summoned?","Yes."
"","If a unit moves within the same site (e.g. surface to underwater, or underwater to surface), does Shark trigger?","No, since the unit is not entering or moving between different sites."
"","What happens if I summon my minion with Genesis into my opponent's Shark's body of water?","See the storyline codex entry for details."
"","Can the Shark's path include movement from surface to underwater, or underwater to surface, if needed?","Yes, as long as the path specified is the fewest steps possible to the target."
"","If a Shark moves through a Silence aura, what happens?","The movement and fight still occur. The specific resolution is: Unit enters the water site, Shark's ability triggers. You specify the movement steps to reach the target, and they all go on the Storyline. Shark starts moving. It enters the Silence aura, but the effects of the ability are still on the Storyline and aren't removed, so they continue resolving normally."
"Gilded Aegis","A minion with Gilded Aegis is on a site chosen for Scorched Earth. The Aegis and the minion are being destroyed simultaneously. Does the Aegis have a chance to save the minion before it's destroyed?","Yes."
"","If forcefully burrowed without burrowing, will a unit with Gilded Aegis still die?","Yes."
"Gilman House","Is this effect limited to once per turn?","Nope! You may use it as many times as you want in a turn, if you meet the threshold requirement. Of course, in Constructed play, you'll be limited to four, since you can have at most four Horrible Hybrids in your collection."
"Gnome Hollows","If I have Crusade or House Arn Bannermen affecting my Gnome Hollows, may I summon a 2-power minion there?","Yes. It's first summoned (enters the realm), then ongoing effects are applied (e.g. Crusade)."
"","If Megamoeba starts at 2 power, can it move into Gnome Hollows (thus getting to 3 power)?","Yes. First, Megamoeba enters, then it grows in power immediately after entering."
"","If the most direct path is blocked (Gnome Hollows, Wall of Ice) will the grappling unit move around those obstacles to reach its target?","No. 'Dragged' is equivalent to 'Pull,' and 'Pull' requires each location entered to be closer to the destination. Making any detours wouldn't be getting closer to the Avatar, so the unit cannot take that path."
"Golden Dawn","How do I resolve this effect?","Deal face up to your back row one at a time. Then, shuffle any non-minions and put them on the bottom of your deck. Now all the minions are summoned simultaneously; resolve any effects of those minions being summoned, e.g. genesis effects. Finally, check to see if you're at Death's Door now, and if so, all the summoned minions gain Charge."
"Grapple Shot","The alpha and beta text is different, which should I use?","The Beta text is correct."
"","Do I resolve all the steps at once, or can effects (e.g. Bottomless Pit) interrupt the movement?","See the storyline codex entry for details."
"","Can a disabled unit Grapple Shot?","No, since it would be shooting a projectile, and disabled units can't do that."
"","If I Grapple Shot a minion with Submerge through an area affected by Mariner's Curse, what happens?","When the Grapple Shot projectile hits the unit, the game adds specific movement steps for the ally to the Storyline: Move A (surface) -> B (surface), Move B (surface) -> C (surface). Then, we start resolving those steps. If Mariner's Curse is on site B, once the unit being dragged reaches site B, it will be submerged, and live. Then the game tries to resolve Move B (surface) -> C (surface), which fails, since the unit isn't on the surface of site B anymore. Thus, there's no strike from Grapple Shot since it didn't reach the hit unit's location."
"","If the most direct path is blocked (Gnome Hollows, Wall of Ice) will the grappling unit move around those obstacles to reach its target?","No. 'Dragged' is equivalent to 'Pull,' and 'Pull' requires each location entered to be closer to the destination. Making any detours wouldn't be getting closer to the Avatar, so the unit cannot take that path."
"Great Old One","How does Drought interact with Great Old One?","These are both passive effects, so whichever was played last takes precedence."
"","What does it actually mean to permanently flood the realm, including voids?.","All sites (including rubble) are flooded for the rest of the game, even sites that enter the realm later."
"Great Wall","The foil and non-foil beta cards have different text. Which is correct?","The non-foil beta text is correct. You may use a foil beta Great Wall in tournament play (or the alpha version), but it must be played with the non-foil beta text; ensure your opponent knows the proper text when it's played."
"","Does this stop all kinds of movement through the top border (e.g. Grapple Shot), or just the Move and Attack basic ability?","The Great Wall will stop most kinds of movement on the surface, with a few notable exceptions. Teleportation doesn't cross borders, and if a unit 'moves as if adjacent' (e.g. Waypoint Portal), that also doesn't cross borders. Finally airborne units can fly over the wall as they are not moving 'on the ground.'"
"","The alpha and beta text is different, which should I use?","The beta text is correct."
"Grigori Rasputin","How do I resolve this ability?","Rasputin must be in your cemetery to use this ability. Then, choose the Evil ally you will banish, which may be anywhere and not limited to your own sites. Since Banishing is the cost of the activated ability, resolve the whole activated ability before actually banishing the minion. (This is analogous to the '((Sacrifice))' rules.) Rasputin gains the printed power and abilities of the ally. Resolve Genesis abilities and any 'enter the realm' abilities. Finally, the Banished ally is actually removed from the realm. (Place it under Rasputin as a reminder of the current effect.)"
"Grim Reaper","How does this ability work?","When Reaper kills a minion, the minion is banished instead of dying. In addition, any copies of that minion in play (regardless of who controls them) are also banished. Finally, you search the owner's library of the minion that was killed (and only that player)."
"Grösse Poltergeist","If a unit is carrying the animated artifact, who retains control?","When the artifact is animated, it becomes a minion, and thus cannot be carried. The controller of Grösse Poltergeist gets control."
"","If the unit carrying the animated artifact can also carry minions, who retains control?","Grösse Poltergeist says you gain control, but the game rules say that anyone carrying the artifact gains control. Grösse Poltergiest takes precedence due to the golden rule, and the controller of Grösse Poltergeist gets control."
"Guardian Angel","Can you 'fly to' a minion already sharing your location?","No, that's not 'flying to.' Summon the Guardian Angel to a different location!"
"","What path can I choose when resolving this ability?","See ((Moving to a Specific Location Via a Special Ability or Magic)) in the Codex."
"Guile Sirens","Can it target a unit in a different region?","No. Targeting (by default) requires the source and the target to be in the same region."
"","Does the target minion use its enhanced move abilities?","Yes. When an effect has a unit 'take steps,' it uses its enhanced move abilities granted by keywords such Voidwalk, Burrowing, Submerge, and Airborne."
"","Does it tap the target minion? Can this movement be intercepted?","No and no. This isn't the Move and Attack basic ability, which is what requires tapping and can be intercepted."
"","Consider the group of sites below. An oversized minion occupies 1-2-4-5. Guile Sirens is #5. Can the oversized minion be pulled in any way?","Yes. When pulling or pushing an oversized unit, choose a single location the oversized unit occupies (and meets the requirement of the effect), and push/pull from there. So, you could choose Site 2: Oversized minion is pulled South, and ends up at 4-5-7-8. OR, choose Site 4: Oversized minion is pulled East, and ends up at 2-3-5-6. OR, choose Site 5: Oversized minion isn't pulled at all."
"","Is the ability mandatory?","Yes. It doesn't use the word 'may.'"
"Harbinger","Does Harbinger's ability combo with other effects that allow you to cast minions, e.g. Elder Ruins, Troubled Town, Peculiar Port, etc.?","Yes! It's effectively a passive ability that can be used whenever you cast a spell on your turn. The golden rule, baby!"
"","When I determine my three random squares, what if I roll doubles or triples?","Reroll any duplicated results until you have three ))unique(( squares."
"Harpyon Urge","What path can I choose when resolving this ability?","See ((Moving to a Specific Location Via a Special Ability or Magic)) in the Codex."
"Haystack","Does this apply if my opponent is searching my deck as well?","Yes! Any time your opponent is searching their deck or your deck, they only search the top three cards."
"Headless Haunt","What if my Headless Haunt tries to teleport into an illegal location? (e.g. Gnome Hollows)","The teleport effect fails, and it remains where it was."
"Highland Falconer","What does 'shuffle if needed' mean?","If you searched your spellbook, shuffle it. If you end up summoning a beast from your hand, you may still have searched your spellbook if you wanted."
"Horn of Caerleon","If my minion gains charge from the Horn to Move and Attack and then leaves the Horn's range, can it finish the attack?","Yes, as the minion has already tapped, the rest of the Move and Attack will resolve. Once a charge has been sounded in the heat of battle, there's no stopping it!"
"Howl from Beyond","How do I resolve this effect?","Deal face up, one at a time. Then, draw the voidwalk minions and Monsters, and banish the rest. No minions actually 'enter' the realm with this effect."
"Ice Lance","If Ice Lance doesn't hit anything at the first location where the projectile appears, and then hits something at the 2nd location, how much damage does it do at that 2nd location?","2 damage at the 2nd location. Ice Lance's damage decreases based on locations the projectile enters, not based on how many things it hits or doesn't hit."
"Ignis Rex","What is a fire card?","Fire sites and fire spells are fire cards. See the 'element' codex entry for more details."
"","What is fire damage?","Damage from a fire card."
"Imperial Road","If I play a Village on my opponent's turn via Imperial Road, can I pay 1 mana to summon a Foot Soldier?","The genesis effect triggers, but you don't have any mana available on your opponent's turn, so no."
"Imposter","Can Imposter wear masks of Avatars with pre-game or setup abilities, and if so, what happens?","Yes, you can wear masks of those avatars, and you simply ignore their pre-game or setup abilities since the game has already started by the time you put on the mask. For example: You can use [[Pathfinder]]'s ability even though your atlas has duplicate sites. You don't get to pick a Unique Dragon as [[Dragonlord]]. (Probably not a good choice of masks.) You don't roll for summoning portals as [[Harbinger]]. (Probably not a good choice of masks.) Your decks and card sleeves remain as-is for [[Magician]].  (Probably not a good choice of masks.)"
"","What rarity are Avatars for purposes of including them in my collection?","Consider Avatars unique for purposes of including them in your collection."
"","What happens if I impersonate the Druid and then use the ability to flip?","You will summon Bruin, flip, ... and then immediately lose the game because you no longer have an Avatar in play! Maybe don't include Druid in your collection?"
"Infiltrate","If my Infiltrated unit attacks my opponent's undefended site, do I retain control of it?","No. Once the infiltrated minion no longer has stealth, you ))lose(( control of it."
"Interrogator","When does the enemy avatar have the opportunity to pay life?","Immediately after the strike, before deathrites resolve. For example, if your strike puts them to 2 or less life, they will not be able to pay 3 life."
"","What happens if I strike for 0 damage?","A strike for zero damage is still considered a strike, so it will still trigger Interrogator's ability."
"Into the Abyss","Normally pull effects can't cross regional boundaries. Can I actually pull the target minion into the void?","Yes, obviously!"
"Iron Shackles","Can I target a burrowed minion or a voidwalk minion?","Not unless you have a burrowed spellcaster or a spellcaster in the void. Since the effect uses the word 'target,' the spellcaster must be in the same region as the target. (There are four regions: surface, underground, underwater, void.)"
"Island Leviathan","Does it turn into a Monster minion?","Yes. It becomes a minion with the Monster type, and no longer a site."
"","If the flooded Rubble gets replaced with a site, is the new site also flooded?","No."
"","When it awakens, is it summoning sick?","Assuming it was in play prior to the turn it awakened, it is not summoning sick (since it was already under your control prior to this turn)."
"","Is the ability optional?","Yes. It is an activated ability with no cost and a requirement of 8 water threshold. Like all activated abilities, you can only activate it during your Main Phase when nothing else is happening, but you are not required to activate it."
"","Does it continue to provide water affinity after it transforms into a Monster?","Yes. The flooded rubble does not provide any affinity to you (since you don't control it), but the Island Leviathan itself does provide affinity, since that's aligned with the golden rule. Obviously if the Monster dies, then you lose that affinity."
"Jack the Ripper","Is Jack the Ripper a Monster as well as a Mortal?","Yes! The inclusion of the capitalized 'Monstrous' in his typeline makes him a Monster (and thus Evil)."
"Jihad","The term 'summon' means 'enter the realm.' So, does that mean I can play minions here for free?","No. This effect simply provides additional locations where you may summon your fire minions."
"Joust!","When exactly do the minions fight?","After both units have taken their step they will fight from their new locations. If either doesn't move, they haven't passed each other and therefore no joust takes place."
"Kairos the Archivist","How do I 'archive the state of the realm' ?","Take a snapshot of the cards in the realm. Players should literally take a picture of it on their phone! If you include this card in your deck, you should be prepared to take a picture during the game. Make additional notes as needed to track things like whether a unit has used its Pick Up and Drop ability for the turn, the controller of a Mesmerized minion, or if there's an ongoing effect on a minion like ))Power(( of Flight. Players are expected to make additional notes as needed to be able to recreate the state of those cards, if a picture alone is insufficient."
"","When I 'archive the state of the realm,' does that include players' life totals?","No. Players' life totals will not revert when Kairos's deathrite resolves."
"","When I 'archive the state of the realm,' does that include cards outside the realm?","No! It does not include any other zone. The thing to focus on are literally the state of cards in the realm right now."
"","Do I archive global effects like Critical Strike?","No, since it's not an 'archived card,' but instead an ongoing effect that hasn't yet been applied. The test for inclusion in the archive is if the effect is currently applying to a card in the realm. E.g. Whether or not you've discarded a card for Wizard's Den would be included in the archive."
"","When a card is 'returned to its recorded state,' does it enter the realm?","No, it is not entering the realm. Genesis, Stealth, Lance, etc. will not trigger and sites do not generate mana."
"","How do I 'return all archived cards to their recorded state' ?","Players should look at the picture they took, then return each card to where it was before, though banished cards can never be returned; sometimes knowledge is truly lost. Once Kairos enters the realm, cards will be tracked across zones solely for the purpose of his deathrite. He's that good of a librarian! If tracking a card across zones is not possible due to hidden information, e.g. shuffled into your deck, then the player may return the card from any zone (but never from banished)."
"","When we 'return all archived cards to their recorded state,' do all changes happen simultaneously?","Yes."
"","When a card is 'returned to its recorded state,' does it move or enter the location?","No. It does not enter the location; simply place it wherever the picture shows. This is not movement. It's like we're rewinding time, not actually moving cards around."
"","Let's say the realm is archived, then I cast an artifact into my unit's hands, then my unit moves. Then Kairos dies. Does my unit bring its carried artifact when it returns to its recorded state?","No! Carried artifacts do move with their bearer whenever their bearer moves, but when you 'return to its recorded state,' that's not considered movement! It's a one-of-a-kind direct placement effect. Therefore, the artifact gets left behind, wherever it is. It's like we're rewinding time, not actually moving cards around."
"","When archived cards are returned to the realm, does that include tokens that were archived?","Yes! If a token was in the realm and archived, it will return to its recorded state when Kairos dies. If the token left the realm (and was thus banished), the token still returns to its recorded state, because there are always unlimited copies of tokens available to the players."
"","When we 'return all archived cards to their recorded state,' do all non-archived cards (e.g. cards that entered the realm after Kairos) remain unchanged?","Yes. They remain where they are, though if a recently ))played(( or ))moved(( site is in the way of a site that's returning to its recorded state, the site that's in the way will get banished! See below for more examples and details."
"","When we 'return all archived cards to their recorded state,' what if non-archived sites are in the way?","The site that's in the way gets banished! For example, the realm is archived, then Cloud City moves, then a Lone Tower site fills in the square where Cloud City was archived. Then Kairos dies. The Lone Tower is banished and Cloud City returns to its recorded state!"
"","What about Earthquake or Rubble?","If Kairos archived the realm with Rubble in it, then Rubble will replace whatever sites are there when cards return to their recorded state, banishing any sites in the way! For Earthquake, imagine the following sequence: The realm is archived with sites on squares 3, 8, and 9. Then, a Lone Tower is played on square 4. Earthquake gets played, rearranging sites. Kairos dies. The sites now return to their recorded state. That means the sites that were originally on squares 3, 8, and 9 go back to where they were, all simultaneously. The Lone Tower does not change squares because it was not an archived card. If it's now in the way and in square 3, 8, or 9, it will get banished by the site that's returning there. Don't mess with the Archivist!"
"","Can you give a complicated Kairos example?","Enjoy this one: I have an Kettletop Leprechaun on Gnome Hollows in square 8. You have a Cloud Spirit on Cloud City in square 3. The realm gets archived. Then: Cloud City moves to square 9 and you summon Bluecap Knockers there. I cast a Grim Guisarme into the hands of my Leprechaun, who moves to square 9. I cast a House Arn Bannerman into the Gnome Hollows. Then, Kairos dies. All of the following happen simultaneously: My Kettletop Leprechaun returns to square 8; even though it's a Gnome Hollows and the Leprechaun has 3 power due to the House Arn Bannerman, remember that the 'return' effect is not movement and is not considered 'entering.' The Grim Guisarme is not an archived card, and it remains where it is on square 9. Carried artifacts move whenever their bearer moves, but returning is not a movement effect, so the artifact doesn't automatically come with the Leprechaun. The Cloud Spirit and Cloud City return to square 3; this is not movement, and thus Bluecap Knockers does not prevent it. The Bluecap Knockers find themselves in the void and are banished. There is a Grim Guisarme in the void on square 9 now. Had there been a site on square 3, it would have been banished as Cloud City returned to that square. When in doubt, always apply the Golden Rule, but especially with Kairos!"
"","What if there are multiple Kairos's in play?","Whenever a new Kairos archives the realm, that becomes the most recent snapshot for all Kairos deathrite effects. That is, there is only a single archive of the realm at a time. Archivists unite!"
"","What if Kairos dies on The Geistwood?","Since the deathrite effect and genesis effect will be triggered simultaneously, you may order them as you wish. If you resolve the printed deathrite first, archived cards will return to their recorded state, then the printed genesis effect will not resolve, since Kairos is banished. If you resolve the printed genesis first (as a deathrite due to The Geistwood), the realm will be archived, and then when the printed deathrite resolves, it would return to that very recently archived state, and Kairos would be banished."
"","Can your avatar end up in the void after Kairos dies, and if so, what happens?","It's theoretically possible! If it does happen, the mandatory actions rule will apply to you, and if you have a site in hand, you'll be required to play it. The way it could happen is left as an exercise for the reader!"
"","Is the state of the Storyline archived? Does the Storyline get restored to its snapshotted state?","No! The Storyline isn't archived, and it simply continues to resolve normally after Kairos's deathrite. For example, I have Infernal Legion in the realm on square 8. Then I summon Kairos and the realm is archived. The Infernal Legion moves to square 3, and I summon Vatn Draconis. During my End Phase, I have ((simultaneous triggers)) for Infernal Legion and Vatn Draconis. I choose to order the storyline with Vatn Draconis first, then Infernal Legion. So I resolve Vatn Draconis's ability, which kills Kairos. Kairos's deathrite goes on the storyline and resolves before the Infernal Legion ability. When I archived the realm, the storyline was empty. But that doesn't matter because the storyline is different from the realm. We return cards to their recorded state, placing the Infernal Legion back on square 8, and then continue resolving the current storyline, so the Infernal Legion's ability resolves when it's on square 8, even though the ability was added to the storyline when the Legion was on square 3."
"Karkemish Chimera","Units A, B, and C are being attacked; can unit D defend the attack and protect A, B, and C, or just one of them?","Just one; you must choose unit A, B, or C to be defended."
"","Units A, B, and C are being attacked; can unit A defend the attack against B, so that B takes no damage?","No, since A is already being attacked, they cannot take the Defend reaction."
"","Do each of the attacked units take 6 damage, or is the damage split as the attacker chooses?","The damage is split as the attacker chooses."
"King Arthur","How does the Philosopher's Stone work with multi-element cards, such as King Arthur and Queen Guienevere? Would King Arthur, who requires 4 mana, cost 3 or 0 Mana to cast using the Stone","Cards that have different element symbols count as a spell of each of those affinities. So Arthur and Guinevere are each an Air spell, an Earth spell, a Fire spell, and a Water spell, all at the same time. But you are still casting them together as a single spell. So, assuming Arthur is your spellcaster's first spell of the turn, the Stone will offer a discount of 1 mana for Arthur, making him cost 3 mana. 

This also means that when Arthur is played he uses up the Stone for that spellcaster's turn because he's simultaneously the first Air, Earth, Fire, and Water spell played this turn. So the Spellcaster cannot continue to use the stone that turn."
"King of the Realm","What Mortals are affected by the first ability?","All Mortals, anywhere in the realm."
"","If a Mortal with Deathrite dies, who gets the Deathrite ability?","The King's controller, since Deathrite triggers while the units are technically still in the realm."
"","What happens if a second King of the Realm enters play?","See '((Example - Two Kings of the Realm))' in the codex."
"","If my opponent plays a Mortal with a Genesis ability and I have a King in play, who gets the Genesis ability?","The player with the King gets the benefit, since they control the Mortal as soon as it's in play."
"Kingdom of Agartha","If Kingdom of Agartha's ability is active, can I choose to summon minions underground without a printed Burrowing ability?","Yes. Kingdom of Agartha affects minions everywhere."
"","When is Kingdom of Agartha's ability active?","Whenever you have three earth affinity! It is not optional; it's a passive ability that's always on while you have the necessary affinity."
"Kythera Mechanism","How does this interact with Court Jester?","You don't get to look at your opponent's hand, but you do get to choose which of their cards they discard (e.g. site or spell)."
"","If two are played, which one takes precedence?","The most recently played one. See 'ongoing effects' for more details."
"","If there are two in play (and mine was played first), then I drop mine and pick it back up, do I take precedence?","No. Competing passive abilities are tracked based on when the card entered play."
"Land Deed","What happens if I have a minion that occupies more than one site (e.g. Mountain Giant) and also carries Land Deed?","Land Deed only grants you control of the site that Land Deed occupies."
"","If I gain control of a site in the middle of my turn, does it produce mana immediately?","No. Sites produce mana at the start of your turn and when they enter the realm. Since the site with Land Deed was already in the realm, it doesn't produce mana merely because you took control of it."
"","What happens if I have a Land Deed on Rubble?","You control the Rubble and your avatar will lose life if the Rubble takes damage, but the Rubble still doesn't provide mana. i.e. you own a hunk of worthless rock!"
"Leap Attack","Does this card count as an 'attack' since it has the word 'attack' in its name?","Sorry for the confusion, but no, this is not actually an attack! You only get an 'attack' from the Move and Attack basic ability, or card text that specifically uses the word attack (e.g. Crave Golem). This card text uses the word 'strike,' which means the unit simply deals damage equal to its power (and there's no chance for the opponent to Defend, and you can strike Stealthed or Airborne units, etc.)"
"Lightning Bolt","Can I lightning bolt the void?","Yes, but only if the spellcaster is in the void (since Lightning Bolt targets, the spellcaster must be in the same region)."
"Locusts of Illyria","Do I summon a copy the turn I first summon the Locusts?","Yes! At the end of the turn you first summon them, they will see that there are no 'new' Locusts (meaning Locusts summoned by the triggered ability), and thus summon a copy. The following turn if you still have two in the realm, you'll only get one more."
"Lord of Fear","What does 'defend alone' mean?","When the Defend window closes (see '((Attack))' in the codex for details), If only a single enemy unit uses the Defend ability, the Defender is removed from the fight and the original attack target is reinstated. Defenders still arrive one at a time, but if there's only one, the defense effectively is negated (though that one defender still got to tap and move to the attack's location)."
"Lord of Greed","How do I properly resolve this effect?","Lord of Greed may and must take a carriable artifact from anywhere in the realm, including from another unit sharing a location with him. In this case, 'elsewhere' means anywhere other than Lord of Greed's hands! He will take from allies as well. This does not target the artifact, but per the golden rule, he cannot take what he cannot detect, and thus artifacts carried by minions with stealth are safe from Lord of Greed."
"Lucky Charm","The alpha and beta text is different, which should I use?","The beta text is correct."
"Maddening Bells","If Maddening Bells tries to increase the cost of a spell that has an alternate casting cost of 0 (e.g. Deathspeaker ability while on death's door, Aramos Mercenaries), what happens?","The spell costs 2. See '((Cost))' for more details."
"","When summoning minions, does Maddening Bells care about the location where the minion is summoned, or where the spellcaster is?","Only where the spellcaster is, not the summoning location."
"","If the Spellcaster is nearby Maddening Bells but the spell affects something not nearby, does it still cost 2 extra mana?","Yes. Maddening Bells's ability only cares about the Spellcaster's position."
"Maelström","Does the movement get resolved simultaneously?","Yes, all the steps are simultaneously resolved (which might then provoke a variety of triggers)."
"","If I choose to pull a minion, do I have to pull all minions?","Yes."
"","Can I use Floodplain before Maelström triggers?","No. Floodplain is an activated ability, which can only be activated during your Main Phase."
"","Consider the group of sites below. An oversized minion occupies 1-2-4-5. Maelström is #5. Can the oversized minion be pulled in any way?","Yes. When pulling or pushing an oversized unit, choose a single location the oversized unit occupies (and meets the requirement of the effect), and push/pull from there. So, assuming Sites 2 and 4 are water sites as well, you could choose Site 2: Oversized minion is pulled South, and ends up at 4-5-7-8. OR, choose Site 4: Oversized minion is pulled East, and ends up at 2-3-5-6. OR, choose Site 5: Oversized minion isn't pulled at all."
"Magellan Globe","If Magellan Globe is in play, can an aura or an oversized unit be cast on the edge of the realm, spanning the realm?","Yes. Ensure that the game state is clear, so all players know which sites the aura occupies, using notes as needed."
"","If Magellan Globe is in play and an Oversized unit on the top row moves 'up' one row to wrap around to the bottom, what happens?","Since Magellan Globe is an ongoing effect that connects the top and bottom edges, the oversized unit can occupy 2 locations on the top row and 2 locations on the bottom row. Ensure that game state is clear, using notes as needed."
"","If Magellan Globe leaves play when a card is spanning the edge of the realm, what happens?","Units cannot balance on the edge of the realm and an oversized unit that finds its way there falls to one side or the other. Its controller places it in the closest legal position, controller's choice if tied."
"","What happens if I cast a spell that does grid-based damage?","The grid can span edges of the realm as needed, since they are connected."
"","Will effects that check 'adjacent' or 'nearby' (e.g. Poison Nova) span edges of the realm?","Yes."
"","Can projectiles go around the edges of the realm?","Yes, as long as they don't change regions. There are exactly four regions in Sorcery: Surface, Void, Underwater, Underground."
"","Can I play Earthquake or other similar 2x2 area effects around the edge of the realm with Magellan Globe in play?","Yes."
"","Can Airborne units in one corner of the realm fly directly to the opposite corner if Magellan Globe is in the realm?","Yes."
"","Are there any other corner cases for Magellan Globe?","I think you mean edge cases! Let us know if you think of any more we should add. In general, apply the golden rule and have fun!"
"Magician","What if an effect directs me to draw a spell, but it turns out there's a site on top of my spellbook?","All cards in your spellbook are considered spells while in your spellbook, so you can draw it normally."
"","What if an effect directs me to draw a site?","You have no atlas, and thus any effect that causes you to draw sites will not resolve. You don't draw any cards and you don't lose the game. You cannot choose to draw from your atlas in your start phase."
"","What if an effect specifies a spell or site from a zone other than my spellbook?","If an effect cares about spell vs. site while the card is outside of your spellbook, you must follow the effect correctly at the moment the effect resolves. Several examples: If resolve Stone Rain, you must honestly state how many sites you have in your hand at that moment. You can partially remove cards from their sleeves and show the back to demonstrate the accurate count to your opponent, or call a judge in a tournament if you have foil cards (or double sleeve your cards with different inner color sleeves in the case of foils). If your opponent plays Pith Imp, you must honestly specify your spells in hand, and randomly select from only those. If your opponent attacks your Wizard's Den for the first time and you don't have any spells in hand, you must honestly demonstrate to your opponent that you only have sites in hand. If you play Sisters of Avalon and have no spells in hand, you must honestly demonstrate to your opponent that you have no spells. After an effect resolves that requires you to reveal the number of spells and sites in your hand, you may then mix up the cards in your hand again so that your opponent doesn't know which cards are spells and which are sites."
"","Am I required to sleeve my cards, and if so, how should I do it?","You are required to sleeve your cards, and they should all be the same. Cards in your spellbook and collection should be indistinguishable whether they are sites or spells."
"Makeshift Barricade","If I do 1 damage to three minions simultaneously, does the Barricade break?","Yes, because 1+1+1 = 3 damage dealt all at the same time."
"Mariner's Curse","What if this is animated by an Enchantress?","If an animated Mariner's Curse moves and enters a water site, it will submerge itself (if possible) and die (assuming it doesn't have Submerge). If it hasn't died, it will then return itself to its owner's hand. It will not have a chance to attack before its effect resolves, because the move happens before the attack."
"","If I Grapple Shot a minion with Submerge through an area affected by Mariner's Curse, what happens?","When the Grapple Shot projectile hits the unit, the game adds specific movement steps for the ally to the Storyline: Move A (surface) -> B (surface), Move B (surface) -> C (surface). Then, we start resolving those steps. If Mariner's Curse is on site B, once the unit being dragged reaches site B, it will be submerged, and live. Then the game tries to resolve Move B (surface) -> C (surface), which fails, since the unit isn't on the surface of site B anymore. Thus, there's no strike from Grapple Shot since it didn't reach the hit unit's location."
"","An oversized unit occupies a specific site and then moves. After the move, it still occupies that site. Did it enter the site?","No. It was already there, and remained there (though it may have entered different sites due to its move)."
"Mask of Mayhem","If I double twice, is it multiplied by 4?","Yes."
"Master Tracker","Once the Master Tracker leaves play, does a future enemy that arrives with Stealth still have stealth?","Yes. But enemies that already lost Stealth won't regain it."
"Mayor of Milborne","Does this buff my opponent's Mortals as well?","Yes! The Mayor wants as many votes as possible!"
"Megamoeba","If I play Dodge Roll on my Megamoeba, does the attack still go through because the Megamoeba is still occupying the original location?","Yes, the target is still valid, but Megamoeba now has +1 power from the extra location it occupies thanks to Dodge Roll."
"","If my opponent uses an effect that moves sites (e.g. Atlas Wanderer, Earthquake, etc.), what happens?","Megamoeba moves with the site. Megamoeba is mostly treated a normal size unit for movement effects."
"","If Megamoeba starts at 2 power, can it move into Gnome Hollows (thus getting to 3 power)?","Yes. First, Megamoeba enters, then it grows in power immediately after entering."
"","What happens if Megamoeba is the target of Whirling Blades?","The Megamoeba moves 2 steps by extending a pseudopod twice (possibly from two different starting locations), and gains 2 power. Then, it strikes all enemies in the starting and destination locations of the pseudopods that took the steps."
"","When the Megamoeba is teleported, does its passive ability still apply?","Yes. A single pseudopod enters the teleportation destination, and the Megamoeba can become a single oversized unit that spans non-adjacent squares. The Megamoeba is weird."
"","What happens if Megamoeba is in a Silence aura?","As soon as it enters the Silence aura, it loses its abilities, but size is considered a characteristic and thus persists. Therefore, it continues to occupy all the locations, but it doesn't get the +1 power per location. It will move like any other oversized unit (albeit potentially strangely shaped)."
"","Can Megamoeba declare a movement to a location it already occupies? (e.g. if it wanted to move an artifact it was carrying)","Yes. Megamoeba is weird."
"","What happens when Megamoeba gets pulled / pushed?","Choose a specific location it occupies and pull / push a single pseudopod from there."
"","If the Megamoeba occupies a site with an enemy, can the Megamoeba take the Move and Attack basic ability to move first, and then attack that original enemy, thus growing in power beforehand?","Yes."
"","If the Megamoeba occupies a site with an enemy, and the Megamoeba moves to a different site without attacking, can the enemy intercept?","Yes! If Megamoeba uses Move and Attack, then doesn't attack, any enemy that shares a location with them may tap to intercept."
"","What happens if Megamoeba gains burrow or submerge?","It can occupy both the surface location and the subsurface location on a site, and each occupied location will grant +1 power, per card text. 40 power Megamoeba, here we come!"
"","What happens if Megamoeba is forcefully burrowed or submerged without the burrow or submerge ability?","If any part of unit occupies an inhospitable location, it dies. So, the Megamoeba would die in this case."
"","What happens when the Megamoeba gets carried?","It occupied all the locations it was carried through."
"Mephistopheles","How do I resolve this effect?","If you cast Mephistopheles, your Avatar is banished. Mephistopheles is now your Avatar. He retains Unique rarity, Demon type, and Air element, but he's no longer a minion and only an Avatar. Your current and maximum life remain the same. Notably, you won't be able to play sites normally because Mephistopheles doesn't have that ability. You will still be able to cast spells because Avatars are spellcasters as one of their characteristics. If you manage to summon Mephistopheles without casting him, then he will not replace your avatar, but his second ability will still function."
"Merlin","How does Merlin's ability work and what does 'any time' actually permit?","This is a passive ability, usable any time on your turn, including during your start phase before you draw a card. But, you may still only cast spells when they are normally permitted to be cast (i.e. during your Main Phase when nothing else is on the storyline other than this ability). Technically, if a Crave Golem were attacking during your Start Phase, Merlin could cast a Dodge Roll then!"
"Meteor Shower","Can I choose sites that share a corner?","Yes. 'Border' means adjacent squares, not including diagonals."
"Miracle Workers","If multiple minions including Miracle Workers die at the same time on Geistwood, can Miracle Workers return themselves and/or another minion that's dying to your hand?","No, because Miracle Workers only return minions from the cemetery, and deathrites resolve while the minions are still in the realm. The Miracle Workers could return other minions that died earlier that turn and were in the cemetery."
"Mirage","What happens if I try to use Mirage's alternate play text when it's played via Pathfinder?","When using the Pathfinder's ability, you reveal the site, then play it in an adjacent Rubble or void (then Pathfinder moves there). Mirage's ability cannot be combined with Pathfinder."
"Mirror Realm","How do Smokestacks of Gnaak and Mirror Realm interact?","By the time Mirror ))Realm(( enters the realm, it's already a copy. Thus, it can copy a nearby site, and then promptly loses all abilities of that copied site (but still is the copy, without abilities). See '((Apply Ongoing Effects In Order))' in the codex for nitty-gritty details."
"","What if Mirror Realm loses its abilities after it enters play (e.g. Smokestacks of Gnaak is played later)?","Mirror ))Realm(( remains a copy, but any abilities that were printed on the original site are now ignored."
"","Does Mirror Realm also copy the rarity of the chosen site?","Yes, it's as if you had the exact same card."
"","Can Mirror Realm copy Rift Valley and enter the realm in the special way, as long as it ends up nearby the Rift Valley that it's copying?","Yes."
"Mismanaged Mortuary","Once this is in play, do I put cards into the cemetery that I own or the cemetery that I control?","You always put your cards into the cemetery you own (the one nearby your deck)."
"","If I have Wormelow Tump in play, what happens?","The cemeteries are still swapped, and you protect everything in 'your' cemetery (which is really your opponent's)."
"","If there are an even number of Mismanaged Mortuaries in play, do they cancel out?","Yes."
"Morgana le Fay","Where do I keep Morgana's hand of cards?","See '((Only It Can Cast))' in the codex."
"Mother Nature","Does 'here' mean Mother Nature's location or site?","'Here' references Mother Nature's exact location."
"Mount Ussar Sanctuary","When I flee, is it step by step movement or teleportation?","It's step by step movement!"
"","After fleeing, if I somehow fail to reach the Sanctuary, do I still gain the Ward?","No!"
"","What path can I choose when resolving this ability?","See ((Moving to a Specific Location Via a Special Ability or Magic)) in the Codex."
"Mountain Giant","What happens if a Mountain Giant occupies a Silence aura?","A card's size is generally set when it enters the realm, and is considered one of its characteristics, not an ability. It will not resize."
"","If Magellan Globe is in play and an Oversized unit on the top row moves 'up' one row to wrap around to the bottom, what happens?","Since Magellan Globe is an ongoing effect that connects the top and bottom edges, the oversized unit can occupy 2 locations on the top row and 2 locations on the bottom row. Ensure that game state is clear, using notes as needed."
"","If Polar Explorers or Ruler of Thul are in play and an oversized unit on the top row moves 'up' one row to wrap around to the bottom, what happens?","This ability only allows movement across the borders, not ongoing occupation. Units cannot balance on the edge of the realm and an oversized unit that finds its way there falls to one side or the other. Its controller places it in the closest legal position, controller's choice if tied."
"","If Magellan Globe leaves play when a card is spanning the edge of the realm, what happens?","Units cannot balance on the edge of the realm and an oversized unit that finds its way there falls to one side or the other. Its controller places it in the closest legal position, controller's choice if tied."
"Mountain Pass","You have a minion on my Mountain Pass. Can I summon a minion on the site?","Yes. Though summoning is included in 'entering,' it is not moving on the ground. So you can summon all you want, since summoning isn't moving."
"","Your minion attacks my Mountain Pass. Can my adjacent minion defend?","Technically, my adjacent minion (without Airborne or Voidwalk) could tap to declare a defense, but it wouldn't move to the Mountain Pass, since your attacker is already there. So, my minion would just end up tapped where it started, without actually redirecting the attack. It would almost certainly be better to not declare the defense."
"","What does 'enter this site on the ground' mean?","Entering on the ground only covers movement from the surface of an adjacent site to the surface of the Mountain Pass, excluding Airborne and teleportation."
"","I have a minion on my Mountain Pass, and a voidwalk minion on an adjacent square. Can I move from the void to Mountain Pass?","Yes, since moving on the ground requires the unit to start from the surface of a site. Since the void isn't a site, moving from the void to Mountain Pass isn't considered moving on the ground."
"Mudflow","Once I target the site, do I also pick 'surface' or 'unburrow?'","No, you simply target the site, and then the proper action is applied. If a water site is the target, minions there are surfaced. If a land site is the target, minions there are unburrowed."
"Mudslide","Do I pick left or right for all units together, or can I choose different directions?","Choose left or right, and apply it to every unit at land sites in the column."
"","Does this effect span the void?","Yes."
"Occult Ritual","The alpha, alternate art version of this card from the pledge pack has the text 'Spellcaster nearby,' while the regular foil and non-foil versions have the text 'Spellcaster here.' which is correct?","The normal version is correct. The text should be 'Spellcaster here.' The alternate art version is not legal for tournament play."
"Old Salt Anchorman","Does this ability protect my minions from movement effects like forceful burrowing (e.g. Bury), submerge (e.g. Drown), and teleportation (e.g. Chaos Twister)?","Yes, all of those effects are movement. With Chaos Twister, don't even attempt to blow the card if the target is an ally nearby Old Salt Anchorman."
"","Does this ability prevent my opponent from rearranging sites? (e.g. Earthquake, Atlas Wanderers)","No, your opponent can still rearrange sites, because that doesn't count as moving the units, just the sites."
"Onyx Core","When does this artifact provide mana?","When it enters the realm, and at the start of its controller's turn."
"Orb of Ba'al Berith","Is the Orb the spellcaster for the copied spell?","Yes."
"Ormund Harpooneers","Does the target need to be in the same region as the Harpooneers?","No. Normally the answer is yes, but the card text 'above or ((below))' means that normal targeting restrictions are ignored, and the Harpooneers can be in any region (surface, underground, underwater, or in the void). As long as there is an adjacent Water site to the Harpooneers and a minion occupying that water site, it will get pulled to the Harpooneers' location."
"","Does the 'adjacent Water site' need to be in the same region as the Harpooneers?","No. Because the Water site is not targeted, and because the card text uses 'site' instead of 'location,' the site does not need to be in the same region as the Harpooneers."
"Orpheus' Crossing","On my turn when I go to Death's Door, can I still take damage and lose life?","Yes. You cannot lose the game due to taking damage, but taking damage and losing life will reduce your life total if possible. See '((Death's Door))' for more details."
"Pact with the Devil","If a non-minion (e.g. River of Flame, or Orb of Ba'al Berith) is the spellcaster, can I sacrifice it?","Yes!"
"","Do you round up your life loss, or round up your ending life?","Round up the life loss. For example, if you had 3 life, you'd lose 2, ending up at 1."
"Pathfinder","The alpha and beta text is different, which should I use?","The beta text is correct."
"","Where does Pathfinder play its first site turn 1?","You must play your first site turn 1 under the Pathfinder per the game rules."
"","Does Pristine Paradise provide mana the turn the Pathfinder plays it from the atlas? That is, does the site have enough time to make mana before the Pathfinder moves onto it?","Yes, sites immediately generate mana when they come into play."
"","What happens if I try to use Mirage's alternate play text when it's played via Pathfinder?","When using the Pathfinder's ability, you reveal the site, then play it in an adjacent Rubble or void (then Pathfinder moves there). Mirage's ability cannot be combined with Pathfinder."
"","If I have no sites but it's not the first turn (e.g. Roots of Yggdrasil destroyed everything) and I use the Pathfinder's ability, am I forced to play the site under the Pathfinder's current location, or could I play the site adjacent?","Since it's not the first turn of the game, you aren't forced to play under yourself. The Pathfinder offers an alternate way to play sites, and thus you could play it adjacent if you wanted."
"","What happens if I try to use Rift Valley's ability when it's played via Pathfinder?","When using the Pathfinder's ability, you reveal the site, then play it in an adjacent Rubble or void (then Pathfinder moves there). With Rift Valley, you could use its ability to make a void adjacent to Pathfinder, then play it there (and Pathfinder would then move there)."
"","Can I use this ability even if I'm surrounded by sites, in the hopes that Rift Valley is on top of my atlas?","Yes, you may use the ability. Assuming a normal site (and not Rift Valley) is on top of your atlas, you'll reveal it, do nothing, and then put it back on top of your atlas."
"Payload Trebuchet","Do both units need to have been in play for a turn or have charge?","Yes. Summoning sick units can't be tapped to pay costs."
"Persecutor","Can I brand an enemy and step toward the closest Evil on the same turn?","No, you must choose only one option each turn."
"","Can I brand an enemy in a different region, or one with Stealth?","Yes! Branding does not target, and therefore you can choose minions in different regions and/or those with Stealth. This can combo successfully with other cards that care about minions being Evil!"
"","Can I brand an enemy who can't be modified, e.g. Monks of Kobalsa? Can I brand an enemy even if no minions are Evil, e.g. Saint of Redemption?","Yes, you can still brand them, and your cards will still treat them as Evil. They aren't actually being modified or becoming Evil; your cards just treat them that way."
"","If my opponent has a warded minion and I brand it as Evil, does it lose Ward?","No, because only your cards treat it as Evil. Also, branding does not target, so Ward won't break for that reason either."
"","When determining 'closest Evil,' do I only consider units in my region?","Yes! See '((Closest))' for more details."
"Phantom Steed","What happens when a minion carries another minion that's carrying a minion?","Only the minions you're directly carrying count against your limit. Have fun at the carnival!"
"Philosopher's Stone","If I have two (e.g. via Replication), do the effects stack?","Yes."
"","How does the Philosopher's Stone work with multi-element cards, such as King Arthur and Queen Guienevere? Would King Arthur, who requires 4 mana, cost 3 or 0 Mana to cast using the Stone","Cards that have different element symbols count as a spell of each of those affinities. So Arthur and Guinevere are each an Air spell, an Earth spell, a Fire spell, and a Water spell, all at the same time. But you are still casting them together as a single spell. So, assuming Arthur is your spellcaster's first spell of the turn, the Stone will offer a discount of 1 mana for Arthur, making him cost 3 mana. 

This also means that when Arthur is played he uses up the Stone for that spellcaster's turn because he's simultaneously the first Air, Earth, Fire, and Water spell played this turn. So the Spellcaster cannot continue to use the stone that turn."
"Pith Imp","Where does the stolen spell go?","It goes to a separate zone as if the Pith Imp was carrying the spell; it does not go to your hand. You may look at the spell and your opponent may not (though they do get to see the spell at the moment you steal it)."
"","If Pith Imp somehow gains Spellcaster, can it pretty please cast the spell it stole?","Yes, that does seem fun!"
"Plague of Frogs","Where can I summon the frogs?","You can summon each of them to whatever locations will cause maximum annoyance."
"Polar Explorers","If Polar Explorers or Ruler of Thul are in play and an oversized unit on the top row moves 'up' one row to wrap around to the bottom, what happens?","This ability only allows movement across the borders, not ongoing occupation. Units cannot balance on the edge of the realm and an oversized unit that finds its way there falls to one side or the other. Its controller places it in the closest legal position, controller's choice if tied."
"Pollimorph","Does a pollimorphed animated aura (e.g. Enchantress) return to an aura form later?","No. It is permanently a Frog token, and occupies a single location."
"","If the original minion occupied more than one location, what happens?","The controller of the transformation effect chooses which location the Frog token occupies."
"Pristine Paradise","Does Pristine Paradise provide mana the turn the Pathfinder plays it from the atlas? That is, does the site have enough time to make mana before the Pathfinder moves onto it?","Yes, sites immediately generate mana when they come into play."
"Quagmire","If the genesis resolves, and then my opponent plays Smokestacks of Gnaak nearby, does the Quagmire effect continue?","Yes. The genesis ability creates an effect that lasts until the start of your next turn."
"Queen Guinevere","How does the Philosopher's Stone work with multi-element cards, such as King Arthur and Queen Guienevere? Would King Arthur, who requires 4 mana, cost 3 or 0 Mana to cast using the Stone","Cards that have different element symbols count as a spell of each of those affinities. So Arthur and Guinevere are each an Air spell, an Earth spell, a Fire spell, and a Water spell, all at the same time. But you are still casting them together as a single spell. So, assuming Arthur is your spellcaster's first spell of the turn, the Stone will offer a discount of 1 mana for Arthur, making him cost 3 mana. 

This also means that when Arthur is played he uses up the Stone for that spellcaster's turn because he's simultaneously the first Air, Earth, Fire, and Water spell played this turn. So the Spellcaster cannot continue to use the stone that turn."
"Raise Dead","Where can I summon the raised minion?","After randomly determining the dead minion, you may summon it anywhere."
"Replication","Where can I conjure the copy?","You can conjure it anywhere."
"Rhongomyniad","How does this work?","After the throw, Rhongomyniad is in the final location along its path, and is not carried by any unit."
"","What happens when two things that strike first clash at the same time?","If multiple units in the same fight have an ability that allows them to strike first, they strike at the same time. Then any surviving units without that ability make their strikes."
"Riddle Sphinx","Can I draw a site with this effect?","Try this riddle: Which spell will I draw? Fooled you! Neither of them! (Yes, you can draw a site.)"
"Rift Valley","Can you 'pull apart' a row with a single site?","No. That's not what 'pull apart' means."
"","What is a technical definition of what's happening when you use this card's ability?","Choose a row or column with two adjacent sites and at least one void. Then, 'pull apart' the two adjacent sites as follows: one site stays in its current square, and the other site (along with all other contiguous sites in its row or column) shifts one square. Put Rift Valley in the void that was just created. The shifting of sites and the arrival of Rift Valley happen simultaneously."
"","Can you play Rift Valley into an area affected by Atlantean Fate?","Yes, since Atlantean Fate only affects the site once it's already in play, and Rift Valley modifies how it's played in the first place."
"","How do Smokestacks of Gnaak and Rift Valley interact?","Rift Valley enters the realm using its ability, and only loses its ability once it's in the realm (which by then, it doesn't really matter)."
"","When pulling apart the row or column to place the site, can Rift Valley be played non-adjacent to your other sites?","Yes."
"","Does this move oversized units or auras that occupy more than one square?","No."
"","What happens if I try to use Rift Valley's ability when it's played via Pathfinder?","When using the Pathfinder's ability, you reveal the site, then play it in an adjacent Rubble or void (then Pathfinder moves there). With Rift Valley, you could use its ability to make a void adjacent to Pathfinder, then play it there (and Pathfinder would then move there)."
"","Can Mirror Realm copy Rift Valley and enter the realm in the special way, as long as it ends up nearby the Rift Valley that it's copying?","Yes."
"","If I have no sites but it's not the first turn (e.g. Roots of Yggdrasil destroyed everything) and I play Rift Valley, am I forced to play the site under my avatar, or could I pull apart a row of Rubble and play it there?","Since it's not the first turn of the game, you aren't forced to play under yourself. Rift Valley offers an alternate way to play a site, and thus you could pull apart a row and play it there if you wanted."
"Riptide","Can riptide pull a voidwalk minion in the void?","No, because minions in the void aren't 'aboveground.'"
"","What are the details of pulling an oversized minion that occupies the water site and other locations?","When pulling or pushing a oversized unit, choose a single location the oversized unit occupies (and meets the requirement of the effect - e.g. adjacent), and push/pull from there."
"River of Blood","If there are two Rivers of Blood in play, do they stack?","Yes. Half the healing (rounding down), then half the healing again (round down). So [[Divine Healing]] would heal 1 with two Rivers of Blood in play."
"River of Flame","If River of Flame casts a spell, choosing the surface, but there are Maddening Bells underground, is the River of Flame affected?","Yes! Those bells are so loud (and still nearby the caster)."
"","If River of Flame casts a spell, must you pick a region that it's casting from?","Yes. Pick surface or underground when you cast the spell (or underwater if it's flooded)."
"Roaming Monster","The term 'summon' means 'enter the realm.' So, does that mean I can play this minion for free?","No. This effect simply provides additional locations where you may summon this minion."
"Rolling Boulder","What happens if Magellan Globe is in play and I push it along a complete row or column?","The Rolling Boulder continues until it would repeat a step (i.e. back to where it started), and then stops instead of repeating a step. It doesn't do 8 damage on the starting location, since a location is either along its path or not."
"","If there are two units on a site and one of them uses the boulder, does the other one get damaged?","Yes. It's dangerous to play with boulders."
"","What path does the boulder take?","It travels in a chosen cardinal direction, staying within the same region."
"Roots of Yggdrasil","What happens to destroyed Rubble?","Nothing (it turns into more Rubble, and thus doesn't change)."
"Rowdy Boys","When exactly is 'after striking' ?","After effects concurrent with striking (e.g. after gaining life via Daperyll Vampire), but before any Deathrite abilities resolve. It's in the same moment that Stealth would break due to striking."
"Ruby Core","When does this artifact provide mana?","When it enters the realm, and at the start of its controller's turn."
"Ruler of Thul","If Polar Explorers or Ruler of Thul are in play and an oversized unit on the top row moves 'up' one row to wrap around to the bottom, what happens?","This ability only allows movement across the borders, not ongoing occupation. Units cannot balance on the edge of the realm and an oversized unit that finds its way there falls to one side or the other. Its controller places it in the closest legal position, controller's choice if tied."
"Scatter","Does the site itself get pushed?","No."
"","Can I choose different directions for each card being pushed?","Yes."
"Scorched Earth","A minion with Gilded Aegis is on a site chosen for Scorched Earth. The Aegis and the minion are being destroyed simultaneously. Does the Aegis have a chance to save the minion before it's destroyed?","Yes."
"","If I target Bedrock with Scorched Earth, the Bedrock obviously isn't destroyed, but is everything else still destroyed?","Yes. (Remember Avatars cannot be destroyed.)"
"","Can I choose zero sites?","Yes. 'Any number' includes zero."
"Scourge Zombies","If Scourge Zombies and an allied mortal die at the same time (e.g. Minor Explosion), does the Zombie's ability bring it back immediately?","No, since the Scourge Zombies must be in the cemetery for their ability to trigger when the mortal dies."
"Sea Raider","If Sea Raider attacks a 3 power minion, killing it but also dying in the process, does the Raider have time to use their ability before they die?","Yes. After units are killed, there is time for effects to resolve (e.g. Deathrite) before minions are placed in cemeteries. This effect resolves in the same window of time as deathrites."
"","If I declare an attack against one target, but then a different enemy defends, does that satisfy this ability?","Yes. An attack was made, and then a minion was killed. As long as your attacking unit used the Move and Attack ability and then got kill credit, this ability is satisfied."
"Seasoned Sellsword","If my avatar is nearby Seasoned Sellsword, can I discard a card for her ability even if I already control her?","Yes!"
"Seirawan Hydra","How can I kill a Hydra?","Deal 1 lethal damage, or 6 damage all at once. Multiple sources of simultaneous damage will work. For example, if the Hydra attacks and two [[Bosk Troll]]s defend, the Hydra will be killed. Note that damage done one at a time, e.g. [[Arcane Barrage]], would not kill it, since each individual 1 damage would be immediately healed."
"Selfsame Simulacrum","If it tries to become a basic copy of an aura animated by Enchantress, what happens?","Selfsame Simulacrum becomes an aura (not a minion), since that's the actual text on the animated aura. As soon as Selfsame Simulacrum is an aura, it expands to its proper size based on card text (and default aura rules), and must continue to occupy the location that was specified during casting."
"","Can it enter the realm Submerged if it copies a Submerged minion (or Voidwalk, or Burrowing)?","No. When you cast a minion spell, you specify where the minion will enter the realm at time of casting. When the minion actually enters the realm (i.e. it's summoned), that's when Selfsame Simulacrum's copy ability applies. Without Submerge / Burrowing / Voidwalk when it's cast, Selfsame Simulacrum can't use those abilities to change where it's summoned."
"","Does it copy Genesis abilities?","Yes."
"","What if it loses its abilities (e.g. Silence aura)?","Selfsame Simulacrum remains a copy, but any abilities that were printed on the original copy are now ignored."
"Shield Maidens","My Shield Maidens attack, and then 3 Foot Soldiers defend. How much damage do my Shield Maidens take?","0, because each source of damage is reduced by 1!"
"Siege Ballista","Do both units need to have been in play for a turn or have charge?","Yes. Summoning sick units can't be tapped to pay costs."
"Silence","What happens if a Mountain Giant occupies a Silence aura?","A card's size is generally set when it enters the realm, and is considered one of its characteristics, not an ability. It will not resize."
"","What happens if a Silence aura is animated by Enchantress?","It still silences other minions but it also silences itself."
"Silver Bullet","Can the bearer cast the spell, even if they're not a spellcaster?","Yes!"
"Sir Morien","Can enemy projectiles be shot from Morien's location?","No, Morien cuts them down immediately, like the total badass he is."
"Sir Tom Thumb","If my opponent's beast snatches Tom up, do they now take control of him?","How dare you!? Sir Tom Thumb is no mere trinket. He's a fully autonomous being and acknowledges no other controller!"
"Skeleton Mage","If Deathspeaker uses his ability to cast Skeleton Mage, does the Skeleton Mage get to use its genesis ability (casting and resolving a spell) before being banished?","Yes!"
"Skirmishers of Mu","How does this ability work?","After declaring their movement path but before actually moving, Skirmishers may shoot. (The game will lookahead to see if your declared path will actually result in movement, ignoring all triggered abilities but considering all ongoing effects.) Alternately, Skirmishers may shoot when they enter a new location during basic movement. They get one shot total during their basic movement, regardless of how far they move. Note that basic movement includes movement from a basic ability, i.e. Move and Attack, and Defend."
"Slimy Mutants","Is this an activated ability that I use while Slimy Mutants are in my hand?","Yes! While Slimy Mutants are in your hand, you may pay (3) and resolve the effect."
"Slumbering Giantess","If attacked by a minion that strikes first, does the Giantess end up striking back?","Yes, assuming she isn't killed."
"Smokestacks of Gnaak","What happens if there are two Smokestacks of Gnaak nearby each other?","See '((Example - Two Smokestacks of Gnaak))' in the codex!"
"","How do Smokestacks of Gnaak and Mirror Realm interact?","By the time Mirror ))Realm(( enters the realm, it's already a copy. Thus, it can copy a nearby site, and then promptly loses all abilities of that copied site (but still is the copy, without abilities). See '((Apply Ongoing Effects In Order))' in the codex for nitty-gritty details."
"","How do Smokestacks of Gnaak and Rift Valley interact?","Rift Valley enters the realm using its ability, and only loses its ability once it's in the realm (which by then, it doesn't really matter)."
"Snowball","Does the snowball's path include both the starting and ending locations?","Yes! The projectile's path determines which locations are affected by the rest of the snowball, gathering up everything along the way, just as you'd expect giant snowball physics would work after watching all those Saturday morning cartoons."
"Sparkmage","Can any of my spellcasters cast a spell and still benefit from my avatar's ability?","Yes! As long as you control the spellcaster, the game sees it as a spell '((you))' cast, meaning the player."
"","Is the damage considered air damage?","Yes."
"","If I give my Sparkmage a poisonous dagger, will it deal lethal damage with its tap ability?","Yes, because it's dealing the damage directly via it's ability. (Damage from a lightning bolt cast by the Sparkmage would not be lethal.)"
"","If I reduce the threshold required to cast the spell (e.g. Mix Aer), does the threshold still count for the Sparkmage ability?","Yes. The Sparkmage ability considers printed threshold on the spell."
"Spear of Destiny","What if the minion being killed occupies more than one location?","You choose where the spear teleports, which will be a single location the minion occupies."
"Spin Attack","Does this card count as an 'attack' since it has the word 'attack' in its name?","Sorry for the confusion, but no, this is not actually an attack! You only get an 'attack' from the Move and Attack basic ability, or card text that specifically uses the word attack (e.g. Crave Golem). This card text uses the word 'strike,' which means the unit simply deals damage equal to its power (and there's no chance for the opponent to Defend, and you can strike Stealthed or Airborne units, etc.)"
"Spire Lich","Does Watchtower satisfy the Spire Lich?","Yes, because of the golden rule. Be cool!"
"Squirming Mass","Let's say the Mass is 1 power, and it fights another 1 power minion. What happens?","Both take 1 damage each, which results in their simultaneous death. That triggers Squirming Mass's ability, which means its gains +1 power, but it's already dying, and merely gaining power isn't enough to save it. (Something specifically that saves a unit from death would be necessary, like Gilded Aegis.) In this example, both minions are placed in the cemetery."
"","If a minion's current power is different from its printed power when it dies, which value does Squirming Mass gain?","The current power of the minion that dies."
"Sturmgeist","If the spellcaster dies before the spell they cast resolves, will their spell still resolve?","No! If the spellcaster is dead before their spell resolves, the spell will not resolve at all. See '((Source is No Longer in the Realm))' for more details."
"Summoning Sphere","Does this allow me to summon my units burrowed even without burrowing?","No. The effect only allows you to break the restriction of choosing one of your own sites, but not the rule about summoning atop the site."
"","The term 'summon' means 'enter the realm.' So, does that mean I can play minions here for free?","No. This effect simply provides additional locations where you may summon your minions."
"Sunken Treasure","Do I get the cards immediately when my minion carrying the treasure moves to the surface, even in the middle of something else (like defending or attacking) ?","Yes! As soon as your unit is on the surface, you resolve the treasure effect."
"Swap","If one target is a minion, can the other target be an artifact, and vice versa?","Yes. Target one (minion or artifact) and target another (minion or artifact)."
"","How exactly do I resolve a 'swap' effect?","The two cards are simultaneously teleported to each other's location. If one of the targets cannot be targeted or teleported (e.g. Iron Man Talus), neither target moves."
"","What if one or both of the swapped cards were being carried?","If either card was being carried by a unit, that unit will be carrying the newly swapped artifact/minion, due to the golden rule. For example, if two carried artifacts are swapped, the bearers will be carrying their newly swapped artifacts (even if they both are in the same location). If a minion is swapped with an artifact, presumably the minion will be immediately dropped (unless the new bearer can carry minions) and the artifact will not be carried (unless the swapped minion was being carried before it was swapped)."
"","What if an oversized unit is involved?","Choose one of the locations the oversized unit occupies as the destination of the other card. See '((Teleporting Oversized Units))' for more details."
"Symmetric Suffering","How do I resolve this effect if I sacrifice a card that has multiple types (e.g. Automaton) ?","When you sacrifice a card that has multiple types, you may specify which type your opponent must match. For example, if you sacrifice one automaton (Minion and Artifact), you can force your opponent to sacrifice a minion or an artifact, your choice (not both). Similarly, if you're playing as Enchantress and you sacrifice an animated aura (Minion and Aura), you can force your opponent to sacrifice a minion or an aura, your choice (not both)."
"Templar","Can any of my spellcasters cast a spell and still benefit from my avatar's ability?","Yes! As long as you control the spellcaster, the game sees it as a spell '((you))' cast, meaning the player."
"Thankless Squire","Once the Thankless Squire has delivered all those lances, and isn't carrying any more, is it still Immobile?","Yes, he's very tired and in need of a rest."
"The Apex of Babel","What does it mean to 'build The Tower of Babel' and 'play ... atop this' ?","You may play The Apex of Babel onto the same square as The Base of Babel! (If you have multiple copes of The Base of Babel in the realm, choose one.) If you do, they merge into a single site called The Tower of Babel. When you build it by playing the Apex, resolve the effect on The Apex of Babel. The Tower of Babel is considered a single site that provides (2) mana and (A)(E), and is both Unique and Exceptional. (The turn you play it, you gain (1) more mana since the Base was already in play.) If it's destroyed, both The Apex of Babel and The Base of Babel go to your cemetery. If it's copied, e.g. Mirror Realm, the copy will provide (2) mana, etc., but you won't get the build bonus again. For all purposes, The Tower of Babel is considered a single site."
"The Base of Babel","What does it mean to 'build The Tower of Babel' and 'play ... atop this' ?","You may play The Apex of Babel onto the same square as The Base of Babel! (If you have multiple copes of The Base of Babel in the realm, choose one.) If you do, they merge into a single site called The Tower of Babel. When you build it by playing the Apex, resolve the effect on The Apex of Babel. The Tower of Babel is considered a single site that provides (2) mana and (A)(E), and is both Unique and Exceptional. (The turn you play it, you gain (1) more mana since the Base was already in play.) If it's destroyed, both The Apex of Babel and The Base of Babel go to your cemetery. If it's copied, e.g. Mirror Realm, the copy will provide (2) mana, etc., but you won't get the build bonus again. For all purposes, The Tower of Babel is considered a single site."
"The Colour Out of Space","If it's not adjacent to void and is within Abundance, does it still gain extra mana?","Yes. The site doesn't provide mana normally, but if it's modified in some way (e.g. Abundance), then it can provide additional mana. 0 + 1 = 1."
"","If it's not adjacent to void and is the target of a flood, does it still gain water affinity?","Yes. The site doesn't provide affinity normally, but if it's modified in some way (e.g. Flood), then it will."
"The Doom of Dilmun","Can this minion die?","The only way it can be killed is if you sacrifice it. Otherwise, it cannot be killed. Meet your doom!"
"The Geistwood","If multiple minions including Miracle Workers die at the same time on Geistwood, can Miracle Workers return themselves and/or another minion that's dying to your hand?","No, because Miracle Workers only return minions from the cemetery, and deathrites resolve while the minions are still in the realm. The Miracle Workers could return other minions that died earlier that turn and were in the cemetery."
"","If The Geistwood site itself and minions occupying the site are all destroyed at the same time, do the minions' genesis abilities still count as Deathrite abilities, or can the active player decide to destroy Geistwood before the deathrites resolve?","Since the destruction is simultaneous (e.g. Roots of Ygdrassil), all Deathrites will resolve before cards are moved to the cemetery."
"The Hexham Haunts","How does summoning burrowed interact with Evil Presence?","You may summon the Haunts to an affected site, and they must be burrowed. But the Haunts won't gain Charge and Evil Presence will remain in the realm because the Haunts were not summoned 'here' according to Evil Presence, since Evil Presence occupies the surface (and perhaps the void), not underground."
"The Immortal Throne","What does 'alone here' mean?","No other units at the location."
"","What counts as 'playing' a card?","Playing a site, which costs 0, or casting a spell."
"","If I modify the cost of a spell (e.g. a Mix artifact, or an alternate casting cost), does The Immortal Throne look at the modified cost or the printed cost?","Cost in this case means 'printed cost.'"
"","The alpha foil version has the text for Pendulum of Peril on it. Is that a misprint?","Yes. Use the text for the normal version. The foil version is not legal for tournament ))play((."
"The Malleus Maleficarum","Can the bearer cast the spell, even if they're not a spellcaster?","Yes!"
"The Void","How does this site work?","The site still has both a surface and subsurface, but those locations also count as void simultaneously. It has a surface + void location, and a subsurface + void location. Minions without voidwalk that enter the site will immediately be banished. Spells cast from the surface + void location can target cards that are in the surface or the void, for example. Projectiles can travel from the surface + void location into the void."
"","Can my avatar enter this site?","Yes."
"","When my opponent casts a minion spell with Voidwalk, can they choose The Void as its summoning location, even though it's my site?","Yes! It is a void, so they can choose to cast their Voidwalk minions to here if they wish."
"","While my Avatar occupies the surface + void location of The Void site, can I target something occupying the underground + void location of The Void site?","Yes! The target is in the same region (void) as the spellcaster, so it can be targeted!"
"Thunderstorm","The alpha and beta text is different, which should I use?","The beta text is correct."
"Tide Naiads","Can Tide Naiads move from an underwater location to an underground location?","No. They would need to enter the underground location to flood it, and they cannot enter underground locations without burrowing."
"Toolbox","Can the bearer cast the spell, even if they're not a spellcaster?","Yes!"
"Torrid Omphalos","Must spells cast by the Omphalos match its elements?","Yes. Any spell the Omphalos casts much match at least one of its elements."
"Torshammar Trinket","How does this work with end of turn and damage clearing?","The intent is that a 1 power minion with 1 damage + the Trinket would survive the turn."
"Tringh Constrictor","The alpha and beta text is different, which should I use?","The beta text is correct."
"Truesight Crossbow","Can the bearer shoot or defend against a stealthed enemy?","Yes. The bearer can target stealthed minions with spells, shoot them with projectiles, attack or intercept them and even defend against their attacks."
"Tufted Turtles","My Tufted Turtles attack (having taken no damage so far this turn), and then 3 Foot Soldiers defend. How much damage do my Tufted Turtles take?","0, because all three Foot Soldiers did damage at the same time, tied for first, and thus all are prevented!"
"Twist of Fate","Does this count as healing?","No, this is setting life."
"","What happens if I cast this when I'm at death's door?","You can cast it, and your opponent will go to 0 life, being put at Death's Door and becoming immune to damage for the rest of the turn. You will still remain at 0 life since you can't gain life once you're at death's door."
"","For purposes of cards that care about the mana cost of spells, what is the mana cost of a spell with X?","If you cast the spell, the mana cost is X. For example, if you cast it for 2 mana, then Immortal Throne would see it as a 2 cost spell. But, if you aren't casting the spell and it's simply in your hand, spellbook, etc., then X is 0 until you actually cast it."
"Ultimate Horror","The alpha foil version has 3 air threshold and the normal version has 2 air threshold. Which is correct?","The normal version is correct. You only need 2 air affinity to cast this minion."
"","When Ultimate Horror summons dead voidwalk minions, can they go to different nearby sites and voids?","Yes!"
"Undertaker Engine","Can it burrow and unburrow different things the same turn?","Yes."
"Undertow","Does Undertow let you pull a unit underwater if they have submerge?","No, because it's a 'normal step,' which doesn't allow changing regions."
"Unland Angler","What are the details of pulling an oversized minion that occupies the water site and other locations?","When pulling or pushing a oversized unit, choose a single location the oversized unit occupies (and meets the requirement of the effect - e.g. adjacent), and push/pull from there."
"Unland Eel","When it submerges, can it pull down a minion anywhere in the realm, or only from its location?","No. Unland Eel can only drag a minion that shares its location."
"Vanguard Knights","If I have two Vanguard Knights equally forward, do they cancel each other out?","Yes. They only get the benefit if they are the true vanguard, with a single minion being the farthest forward."
"","How do I know if they're the 'farthest forward?'","The row of squares closest to you is 1, then the next row is 2, then 3, then 4. The higher the number, the farther forward it is."
"Varmint Warrens","Does this prevent enemy magic from harming my beasts?","Yes, as long as the effect says 'target'. You'll need to bring in a specialized exterminator to flush out these hidey-holes."
"Vatn Draconis","If I choose to submerge minions and artifacts here, do I submerge Vatn Draconis too?","Yes, it will submerge itself. You cannot choose to submerge only some of the minions and artifacts."
"Vaults of Zul","If I play this under my avatar, have I stopped there?","No, because a unit doesn't enter the site if the unit was already present in the square when the site was played."
"","What does 'stops here' mean?","An avatar stops when there is no additional movement for that unit on the Storyline. A unit must first move to then stop."
"","Does Vaults of Zul trigger once per game, or once per game per avatar?","Once per game total. They took time to loot the vaults! (If two avatars somehow stop on the vaults simultaneously, they will both be tied for first, and will both loot the vaults.)"
"","What happens if my turn is skipped via Vaults of Zul and Courtesan Thaïs is affecting me?","If a turn is skipped then there's no actual turn, which means that part of Courtesan Thaïs's effect would wait for that player's next actual turn."
"Vindictive Nation","When moving sites around, does Vindictive Nation protect the nearby sites before or after the move?","Vindictive Nation protects the sites it was nearby before the move. For example:  I = Vindictive Nation R = Rubble A = Allied Site My opponent casts Earthquake and rearranges the two rightmost sites:  Even though site A moved and is now nearby Vindictive Nation, my opponent doesn't lose any life because A wasn't nearby Vindictive Nation before the move. Alternately, if we started from the second situation and Earthquake moved sites into the first situation, my opponent would lose 3 life because they moved a site that was nearby Vindictive Nation (even though the site ended up no longer nearby)."
"","If my Vindictive Nation is silenced by my opponent, e.g. Smokestacks of Gnaak, will my opponent lose life?","No, because Smokestacks silences them first. Vindictive Nation's ability is effectively a triggered ability, while Smokestacks are a passive ability that generates an ongoing effect. Ongoing effects are applied before triggered abilities can trigger."
"","Does this effect have time to resolve if the site itself is getting destroyed?","Yes! They are very vindictive."
"","Does 'modifying' a site include Flooding it?","Yes, since Flooded is an ability that gets added to the site."
"Vivien the Enchantress","What does 'wherever she is' mean?","Anywhere! The realm, your hand, and cemetery, and even while in the middle of your spellbook."
"","Since Avatars are Spellcasters, is Vivien a Spellcaster?","Not by default. Avatars don't have the printed ability 'Spellcaster,' so Vivien must gain the Spellcaster ability another way, e.g. a minion with the printed Spellcaster ability."
"","Can Vivien the Enchantress copy the abilities of another Vivien the Enchantress?","No."
"","What happens if Vivien uses the Druid's ability to summon Bruin and flip?","She summons Bruin and then flips. As a flipped card with nothing on the back, she has no game text and will effectively do nothing for the rest of the game. She is no longer a minion, has no card type or abilities, etc. The flipped card can exist in the void, and technically she could turn off Pristine Paradise, and would be destroyed by Roots of Yggdrasil."
"Wall of Air","Does this affect subsurface units?","No. (They are not atop the site.)"
"","What if this is animated by an Enchantress?","An animated Wall of Air can't move (unless it gains power), since it has a Wall of Air in its middle! If it gains power (or teleports) and manages to move, the Wall of Air applies between the two squares it occupies."
"","Does this affect the corners of the border? (e.g. Airborne units moving diagonally)","No. 'Border' means adjacent squares, not including diagonals."
"","How many squares does this aura occupy?","2"
"Wall of Fire","How many squares does this aura occupy?","2"
"","What does 'passes through' mean?","Moving through in any way, whether willingly or by force. For example, a unit moved by Grapple Shot or Pudge Butcher would take damage from the Wall of Fire. Note that a teleported unit doesn't pass through borders, and thus wouldn't be affected."
"","Does this affect Airborne units?","Yes. (They are atop the site.)"
"","Does this affect the corners of the border? (e.g. Airborne units moving diagonally)","No. 'Border' means adjacent squares, not including diagonals."
"","What if this is animated by an Enchantress?","It can move, but units are not passing through the Wall of Flame due to its own movement. After moving, its effect will apply between the two squares it occupies."
"","Does this affect subsurface units?","No. (They are not atop the site.)"
"Wall of Ice","How many squares does this aura occupy?","2"
"","What if this is animated by an Enchantress?","An animated Wall of Ice can't move normally, since it has a Wall of Ice in its middle! If it gains Airborne (or teleports, etc.) and manages to move, the Wall of Ice applies between the two squares it occupies."
"Warp Spasm","When is the power doubled?","This effect applies a doubling throughout the turn. If the unit gains or loses power, apply any additions or subtractions first, then double."
"Wave of Eviction","How do I properly resolve this effect?","Choose a cardinal direction from your water site. Forcefully move all enemies from your water site one step in the chosen direction and flood that site. Trigger and resolve any effects related to minions entering or the site being flooded. Then repeat the process until you reach the edge of the realm. The flood and push effect will continue even across a void, but minions cannot be forcefully moved across regions. Each site will be flooded at the same moment as the minions arrive, so a submerged minion being evicted will also be submerged on the new site (and there will never be a moment where it's pushed onto the new site without the new site also being flooded)."
"Waveshaper","When exactly does the previous site stop being flooded when I use this ability for the second time?","The newly flooded site becomes flooded at the same moment the previously flooded site stops being flooded. If you choose the same site, there is no moment when the site isn't flood."
"","If the site doesn't get flooded (e.g. Bedrock), do the minions without submerge still tap?","Yes! Imagine a big wave washing over the Bedrock, knocking everyone over, and then the water dissipates due to Bedrock."
"","What does 'your body of water' mean?","The body of water (if any) that your Avatar currently occupies. If the Avatar isn't in any body of water, the ability won't function. (They're a fish out of water!)"
"","Can I choose the same site over and over?","Yes, as long as it's nearby your body of water."
"Whirling Blades","Does the path include the starting and ending locations?","Yes."
"","Can a unit with move-related abilities (e.g. Airborne) 'take steps' using its ability?","Yes."
"","Do I fully resolve my movement first, then strike each enemy simultaneously?","Yes."
"","If I choose to move 0 steps (perhaps because my unit is Immobile), do I strike anything?","No, because you don't have any path if you don't move. A path involves 1 or more steps, and each step has a starting and ending location that's different (if your step is from a location to the same location, you didn't actually move anywhere.)"
"Wildfire","Does 'visited before' apply to other Wildfires I cast in the same game?","Once it leaves play, a Wildfire forgets all the places it visited. If you have multiple Wildfires in play, track them each separately."
"Wills-o'-the-Wisp","If Wills-o'-the-Wisps are attacked and then use their ability to evade the attack, what happens?","Attack triggers are still satisfied (e.g. Captain Baldassare), but the attack otherwise ends (assuming there aren't any units left to fight). The attacker will not strike, and the target of the attack will not revert to the original target (if any)."
"","If Wills-o'-the-Wisps are attacked by a oversized minion, and then Wills-o'-the-Wisps teleport to a nearby location that the oversized minion still occupies, does the attack continue?","Yes. To actually evade the attack, they must teleport to a location that the attacker doesn't occupy."
"Windblast","Does the movement get resolved simultaneously?","Yes, all the steps are simultaneously resolved (which might then provoke a variety of triggers)."
"","Can I push something into the void?","No. Since this is forced movement (and not normal unit movement), 'one step' means a single adjacent location. (And 'adjacent location' means an adjacent square in the same region.)"
"","Per card text, artifacts that are carried get pushed as well. So, do held artifacts get blown away from the units carrying them?","Since all of the movement is simultaneous the artifact always shares a location with the unit, so it was never dropped and continues to be carried."
"Witherwing Hero","If a weaker ally is attacked and you return them to your hand via this ability, what happens?","Attack triggers are still satisfied (e.g. Captain Baldassare), but the attack otherwise ends, assuming there aren't any units left to fight. The attacker will not strike."
"Zephyranne Airship","What happens when a minion carries another minion that's carrying a minion?","Only the minions you're directly carrying count against your limit. Have fun at the carnival!"
